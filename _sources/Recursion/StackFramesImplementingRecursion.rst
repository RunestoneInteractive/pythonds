Stack Frames: Implementing Recursion
------------------------------------

Suppose that instead of concatenating the result of the recursive call
to ``toStr`` with the string from ``convertString``, we modified our
algorithm to push the strings onto a stack instead of making the recursive
call. The code for this modified algorithm is shown in
:ref:`ActiveCode 1 <lst_recstack>`.


.. activecode:: lst_recstack
    :caption: Converting an Integer to a String Using a Stack
    :nocodelens:

    def toStr(n, base, rStack):

        convertString = "0123456789ABCDEF"

        if n < base:
            rStack.push(convertString[n])
        else:
            rStack.push(convertString[n % base])
            toStr(n//base, base, rStack)

    def num_to_string(n, base):

        from pythonds.basic.stack import Stack

        rStack = Stack()

        toStr(n, base, rStack)

        res = ""
        while not rStack.isEmpty():
            res = res + str(rStack.pop())

        return res

    print(num_to_string(1453, 16))

Each time we make a call to ``toStr``, we push a character on the stack.
Returning to the previous example we can see that after the fourth call
to ``toStr`` the stack would look like :ref:`Figure 5 <fig_recstack>`. Notice
that now we can simply pop the characters off the stack and concatenate
them into the final result, ``"1010"``.

   Figure 5: Strings Placed on the Stack During Conversion


The previous example gives us some insight into how Python implements a
recursive function call. When a function is called in Python, a **stack
frame** is allocated to handle the local variables of the function. When
the function returns, the return value is left on top of the stack for
the calling function to access. :ref:`Figure 6 <fig_callstack>` illustrates the
call stack after the return statement on line 4.

   Figure 6: Call Stack Generated from ``toStr(10,2)``


Notice that the call to ``toStr(2//2,2)`` leaves a return value of
``"1"`` on the stack. This return value is then used in place of the
function call (``toStr(1,2)``) in the expression ``"1" + convertString[2%2]``, which will leave the string ``"10"`` on the top of
the stack. In this way, the Python call stack takes the place of the
stack we used explicitly in :ref:`Listing 4 <lst_recstack>`. In our list summing
example, you can think of the return value on the stack taking the place
of an accumulator variable.

The stack frames also provide a scope for the variables used by the
function. Even though we are calling the same function over and over,
each call creates a new scope for the variables that are local to the
function.
