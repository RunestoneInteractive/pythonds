Queue Simulation: Printing Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A more interesting simulation allows us to study the behavior of the
printing queue described earlier in this section. Recall that as
students send printing tasks to the shared printer, the tasks are placed
in a queue to be processed in a first come, first served manner. Many
questions arise with this configuration. The most important of these
might be whether the printer is capable of handling a certain amount of
work. If it cannot, students will be waiting too long for printing and
may miss their next class.

Consider the following situation in a computer science laboratory. On
any average day about 10 students are working in the lab at any given
hour. These students typically print up to twice during that time, and
the length of these tasks ranges from 1 to 20 pages. The printer in the
lab is older, capable of processing 10 pages per minute of draft
quality. The printer could be switched to give better quality, but then
it would produce only five pages per minute. The slower printing speed
could make students wait too long. What page rate should be used?

We could decide by building a simulation that models the laboratory. We
will need to construct representations for students, printing tasks, and
the printer (:ref:`Figure 4 <fig_qulabsim>`). As students submit printing tasks,
we will add them to a waiting list, a queue of print tasks attached to
the printer. When the printer completes a task, it will look at the
queue to see if there are any remaining tasks to process. Of interest
for us is the average amount of time students will wait for their papers
to be printed. This is equal to the average amount of time a task waits
in the queue.

To model this situation we need to use some probabilities. For example,
students may print a paper from 1 to 20 pages in length. If each length
from 1 to 20 is equally likely, the actual length for a print task can
be simulated by using a random number between 1 and 20 inclusive. This
means that there is equal chance of any length from 1 to 20 appearing.

If there are 10 students in the lab and each prints twice, then there
are 20 print tasks per hour on average. What is the chance that at any
given second, a print task is going to be created? The way to answer
this is to consider the ratio of tasks to time. Twenty tasks per hour
means that on average there will be one task every 180 seconds:

:math:`\frac {20\ tasks}{1\ hour} \times \frac {1\ hour}  {60\ minutes} \times \frac {1\ minute} {60\ seconds}=\frac {1\ task} {180\ seconds}`

For every second we can simulate the chance that a print task occurs by
generating a random number between 1 and 180 inclusive. If the number is
180, we say a task has been created. Note that it is possible that many
tasks could be created in a row or we may wait quite a while for a task
to appear. That is the nature of simulation. You want to simulate the
real situation as closely as possible given that you know general
parameters.

Main Simulation Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here is the main simulation.

#. Create a queue of print tasks. Each task will be given a timestamp
   upon its arrival. The queue is empty to start.

#. For each second (``current_second``):

   -  Does a new print task get created? If so, add it to the queue with
      the ``current_second`` as the timestamp.

   -  If the printer is not busy and if a task is waiting,

      -  Remove the next task from the print queue and assign it to the
         printer.

      -  Subtract the timestamp from the ``current_second`` to compute
         the waiting time for that task.

      -  Append the waiting time for that task to a list for later
         processing.

      -  Based on the number of pages in the print task, figure out how
         much time will be required.

   -  The printer now does one second of printing if necessary. It also
      subtracts one second from the time required for that task.

   -  If the task has been completed, in other words the time required
      has reached zero, the printer is no longer busy.

#. After the simulation is complete, compute the average waiting time
   from the list of waiting times generated.

Python Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To design this simulation we will create classes for the three
real-world objects described above: ``Printer``, ``Task``, and
``PrintQueue``.

The ``Printer`` class (:ref:`Listing 2 <lst_printer>`) will need to track whether
it has a current task. If it does, then it is busy (lines 13â€“17) and the
amount of time needed can be computed from the number of pages in the
task. The constructor will also allow the pages-per-minute setting to be
initialized. The ``tick`` method decrements the internal timer and sets
the printer to idle (line 11) if the task is completed.

.. _lst_printer:

**Listing 2**

.. highlight:: python
    :linenothreshold: 5

::

    class Printer:
        def __init__(self, ppm):
            self.page_rate = ppm
            self.current_task = None
            self.time_remaining = 0

        def tick(self):
            if self.current_task is not None:
                self.time_remaining = self.time_remaining - 1
                if self.time_remaining <= 0:
                    self.current_task = None

        def busy(self):
            return self.current_task is not None

        def start_next(self, new_task):
            self.current_task = new_task
            self.time_remaining = new_task.get_pages() * 60 / self.page_rate


.. highlight:: python
    :linenothreshold: 500

The ``Task`` class (:ref:`Listing 3 <lst_task>`) will represent a single printing
task. When the task is created, a random number generator will provide a
length from 1 to 20 pages. We have chosen to use the ``randrange``
function from the ``random`` module.

::

    >>> import random
    >>> random.randrange(1,21)
    18
    >>> random.randrange(1,21)
    8
    >>>

Each task will also need to keep a timestamp to be used for computing
waiting time. This timestamp will represent the time that the task was
created and placed in the printer queue. The ``wait_time`` method can
then be used to retrieve the amount of time spent in the queue before
printing begins.

.. _lst_task:

**Listing 3**



.. sourcecode:: python

    import random


    class Task:
        def __init__(self, time):
            self.timestamp = time
            self.pages = random.randrange(1, 21)

        def get_stamp(self):
            return self.timestamp

        def get_pages(self):
            return self.pages

        def wait_time(self, current_time):
            return current_time - self.timestamp


The main simulation (:ref:`Listing 4 <lst_qumainsim>`) implements the algorithm
described above. The ``print_queue`` object is an instance of our
existing queue ADT. A boolean helper function, ``new_print_task``, decides
whether a new printing task has been created. We have again chosen to
use the ``randrange`` function from the ``random`` module to return a
random integer between 1 and 180. Print tasks arrive once every 180
seconds. By arbitrarily choosing 180 from the range of random integers
(line 31), we can simulate this random event. The simulation function
allows us to set the total time and the pages per minute for the
printer.

When we run the simulation, we should not be concerned that the
results are different each time. This is due to the probabilistic nature
of the random numbers. We are interested in the trends that may be
occurring as the parameters to the simulation are adjusted. Here are
some results.

First, we will run the simulation for a period of 60 minutes (3,600
seconds) using a page rate of five pages per minute. In addition, we
will run 10 independent trials. Remember that because the simulation
works with random numbers each run will return different results.

::

    >>> for i in range(10):
    ...     simulation(3600, 5)
    ... 
    Average Wait 165.38 secs 2 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait  95.07 secs 1 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait  65.05 secs 2 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait  99.74 secs 1 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait  17.27 secs 0 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait 239.61 secs 5 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait  75.11 secs 1 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait  48.33 secs 0 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait  39.31 secs 3 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait 376.05 secs 1 tasks remaining.
    >>> 

After running our 10 trials we can see that the mean average wait time
is (165.38 + 95.07 + 65.05 + 99.74 + 17.27 + 239.61 + 75.11 + 48.33 + 39.31 + 376.05) / 10 = 122.09 seconds. You can also see that there is a large variation in
the average wait time with a minimum average of 17.27 seconds and a
maximum of 376.05 seconds. You may also notice that in only two of the
cases were all the tasks completed.

Now we will adjust the page rate to 10 pages per minute and run the 10
trials again. With a faster page rate, our hope would be that more tasks
would be completed in the one-hour time frame.

::

    >>> for i in range(10):
    ...     simulation(3600, 10)
    ... 
    Average Wait   1.29 secs 0 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait   7.00 secs 0 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait  28.96 secs 1 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait  13.55 secs 0 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait  12.67 secs 0 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait   6.46 secs 0 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait  22.33 secs 0 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait  12.39 secs 0 tasks remaining.
    Average Wait   7.27 secs 0 tasks remaining.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

We were trying to answer a question about whether the current printer
could handle the task load if it were set to print with a better quality
but slower page rate. The approach we took was to write a simulation
that modeled the printing tasks as random events of various lengths and
arrival times.

The output above shows that with 5 pages per minute printing, the
average waiting time varied from a low of 17 seconds to a high of 376
seconds (about 6 minutes). With a faster printing rate, the low value
was 1 second with a high of only 28. In addition, in 8 out of 10 runs at
5 pages per minute there were print tasks still waiting in the queue at
the end of the hour.

Therefore, we are perhaps persuaded that slowing the printer down to get
better quality may not be a good idea. Students cannot afford to wait
that long for their papers, especially when they need to be getting on
to their next class. A six-minute wait would simply be too long.

This type of simulation analysis allows us to answer many questions,
commonly known as what-if questions. All we need to do is vary the
parameters used by the simulation and we can simulate any number of
interesting behaviors. For example,

-  What if enrollment goes up and the average number of students
   increases by 20?

-  What if it is Saturday and students do not need to get to class?
   Can they afford to wait?

-  What if the size of the average print task decreases since Python is
   such a powerful language and programs tend to be much shorter?

These questions could all be answered by modifying the above simulation.
However, it is important to remember that the simulation is only as good
as the assumptions that are used to build it. Real data about the number
of print tasks per hour and the number of students per hour was
necessary to construct a robust simulation.

.. admonition:: Self Check

   How would you modify the printer simulation to reflect a larger number of students?  Suppose that the number of students was doubled.  You make need to make some reasonable assumptions about how this simulation was put together but what would you change?  Modify the code.  Also suppose that the length of the average print task was cut in half.  Change the code to reflect that change.  Finally How would you parametertize the number of students, rather than changing the code we would like
   to make the number of students a parameter of the simulation.
