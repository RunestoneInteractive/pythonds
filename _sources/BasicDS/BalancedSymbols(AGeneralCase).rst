Balanced Symbols (A General Case)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The balanced parentheses problem shown above is a specific case of a
more general situation that arises in many programming languages. The
general problem of balancing and nesting different kinds of opening and
closing symbols occurs frequently. For example, in Python
square brackets, ``[`` and ``]``, are used for lists; curly braces, ``{`` and ``}``, are
used for dictionaries; and parentheses, ``(`` and ``)``, are used for tuples and
arithmetic expressions. It is possible to mix symbols as long as each
maintains its own open and close relationship. Strings of symbols such
as

::

    { { ( [ ] [ ] ) } ( ) }

    [ [ { { ( ( ) ) } } ] ]

    [ ] [ ] [ ] ( ) { }

are properly balanced in that not only does each opening symbol have a
corresponding closing symbol, but the types of symbols match as well.

Compare those with the following strings that are not balanced:

::

    ( [ ) ]

    ( ( ( ) ] ) )

    [ { ( ) ]

The simple parentheses checker from the previous section can easily be
extended to handle these new types of symbols. Recall that each opening
symbol is simply pushed on the stack to wait for the matching closing
symbol to appear later in the sequence. When a closing symbol does
appear, the only difference is that we must check to be sure that it
correctly matches the type of the opening symbol on top of the stack. If
the two symbols do not match, the string is not balanced. Once again, if
the entire string is processed and nothing is left on the stack, the
string is correctly balanced.

The Python program to implement this is shown in :ref:`ActiveCode 1 <lst_parcheck2>`.
The only change appears in line 16 where we call a helper function, ``matches``, to
assist with symbol-matching. Each symbol that is removed from the stack
must be checked to see that it matches the current closing symbol. If a
mismatch occurs, the boolean variable ``balanced`` is set to ``False``.

   from pythonds.basic.stack import Stack
   
   def parChecker(symbolString):
       s = Stack()
       balanced = True
       index = 0
       while index < len(symbolString) and balanced:
           symbol = symbolString[index]
           if symbol in "([{":
               s.push(symbol)
           else:
               if s.isEmpty():
                   balanced = False
               else:
                   top = s.pop()
                   if not matches(top,symbol):
                       balanced = False
           index = index + 1
       if balanced and s.isEmpty():
           return True
       else:
           return False

   def matches(open, close):
       opens = "([{"
       closers = ")]}"
       return opens.index(open) == closers.index(close)
       

   print(parChecker('{{([][])}()}'))
   print(parChecker('[{()]'))

These two examples show that stacks are very important data structures
for the processing of language constructs in computer science. Almost
any notation you can think of has some type of nested symbol that must
be matched in a balanced order. There are a number of other important
uses for stacks in computer science. We will continue to explore them
in the next sections.
