Summary
-------

In this chapter we have looked at the graph abstract data type and some
implementations of a graph. A graph enables us to solve many problems---
provided we can transform the original problem into something that can
be represented by a graph. In particular, we have seen that graphs are
useful to solve problems in the following general areas:

-  Breadth-first search for finding the unweighted shortest path.

-  Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for the weighted shortest path.

-  Depth-first search for graph exploration.

-  Strongly connected components for simplifying a graph.

-  Topological sort for ordering tasks.

-  Minimum weight spanning trees for broadcasting messages.
