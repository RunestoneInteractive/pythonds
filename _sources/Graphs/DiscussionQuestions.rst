1. Draw the graph corresponding to the following adjacency matrix.

.. figure:: Figures/adjMatEX.png
   :align: center


2. Draw the graph corresponding to the following list of edges.

   .. table:: 

           +--------+------+--------+
           | from   | to   | cost   |
           +========+======+========+
           | 1      | 2    | 10     |
           +--------+------+--------+
           | 1      | 3    | 15     |
           +--------+------+--------+
           | 1      | 6    | 5      |
           +--------+------+--------+
           | 2      | 3    | 7      |
           +--------+------+--------+
           | 3      | 4    | 7      |
           +--------+------+--------+
           | 3      | 6    | 10     |
           +--------+------+--------+
           | 4      | 5    | 7      |
           +--------+------+--------+
           | 6      | 4    | 5      |
           +--------+------+--------+
           | 5      | 6    | 13     |
           +--------+------+--------+

3. Ignoring the weights, perform a breadth first search on the graph
   from the previous question.
   
.. mchoice:: question1_1
   :answer_a: O(n)
   :answer_b: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
   :answer_c: O(1)
   :answer_d: O(n<sup>3</sup>)
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: O(n) would suggest that there is no nesting. There are several nested for loops.
   :feedback_b: Correct. The two consecutively nested for loops would dictate that this is in the realm of O(n<sup>2</sup>).
   :feedback_c: O(1) would suggest that the function is constant. Since there are multiple for loops intertwined, it is not in constant time.
   :feedback_d: O(n<sup>3</sup>) would suggest that there are three consecutively nested for loops. There are only two.

9. Draw a dependency graph illustrating the steps needed to send an
   email. Perform a topological sort on your graph.

10. Derive an expression for the base of the exponent used in expressing the 
    running time of the knights tour.
    
.. shortanswer:: DFS

   11. Explain why the general DFS algorithm is not suitable for solving 
    the knights tour problem.
