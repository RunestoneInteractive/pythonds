Programming Exercises
---------------------

#. Modify the depth-first search function to produce a topological sort.

#. Modify the depth-first search to produce strongly connected
   components.

#. Write the ``transpose`` method for the ``Graph`` class.

#. Using breadth-first search write an algorithm that can determine the
   shortest path from each vertex to every other vertex. This is called
   the “all pairs shortest path problem.”

#. Using breadth-first search revise the maze program from
   the Chapter 4 (Recursion) to find the shortest path out of a maze.

#. Write a program to solve the following problem: you have two jugs, a
   4-gallon and a 3-gallon. Neither of the jugs has any markings.
   There is a pump that can be used to fill the jugs with water. How can
   you get exactly two gallons of water in the 4-gallon jug?

#. Generalize the problem above so that the parameters to your solution
   include the size of each jug and the final amount of water to be
   left in the larger jug.

#. Write a program that solves the following problem: three missionaries
   and three cannibals come to a river and find a boat that holds two
   people. Everyone must get across the river to continue on the
   journey. However, if the cannibals ever outnumber the missionaries on
   either bank, the missionaries will be eaten. Find a series of
   crossings that will get everyone safely to the other side of the
   river.
