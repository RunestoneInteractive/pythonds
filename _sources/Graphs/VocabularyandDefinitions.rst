Vocabulary and Definitions
--------------------------

Now that we have looked at an graph, we will more
formally define a graph and its components. We already know some of
these terms from our discussion of trees.

Vertex
    A **vertex** (also called a *node*) is a fundamental part of a graph. It
    can have a name, which we will call the *key*. A vertex may also
    have additional information. We will call this additional
    information the *value* or the *payload*.

Edge
    An **edge** (also called an *arc*) is another fundamental part of a
    graph. An edge connects two vertices to show that there is a
    relationship between them. Edges may be one-way or two-way. If the
    edges in a graph are all one-way, we say that the graph is a
    **directed graph**, or a **digraph**. The class prerequisites graph
    shown above is clearly a digraph since you must take some classes
    before others.

Weight
    Edges may be **weighted** to show that there is a cost to go from one
    vertex to another, which we call **edge cost**.
    For example, in a graph of roads that connect one
    city to another, the weight on the edge might represent the distance
    between the two cities.

With those definitions in hand, we can formally define a graph. A graph
can be represented by :math:`G` where :math:`G =(V,E)`. For the
graph :math:`G`, :math:`V` is a set of vertices and :math:`E` is a
set of edges. Each edge is a tuple :math:`(v, w)` where
:math:`v, w \in V`. We can add a third component to the edge tuple to
represent a weight. A subgraph :math:`s` is a set of edges :math:`e`
and vertices :math:`v` such that :math:`e \subset E` and
:math:`v \subset V`.

:ref:`FigureÂ  2 <fig_dgsimple>` shows another example of a simple weighted
digraph. Formally we can represent this graph as the set of six
vertices:

.. math::

   V = \left\{ v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5 \right\}


and the set of nine edges:

.. math::

   E = \left\{ \begin{array}{l}(v_0, v_1, 5), (v_1, v_2, 4), (v_2, v_3, 9), \\
                                (v_3, v_4, 7), (v_4, v_0, 1), (v_0, v_5, 2), \\
                                (v_5, v_4, 8), (v_3, v_5, 3), (v_5, v_2, 1)
                \end{array} \right\}

   Figure 2: A Simple Example of a Directed Graph

The example graph in :ref:`Figure 2 <fig_dgsimple>` helps illustrate two other
key graph terms:

Path
    A **path** in a graph is a sequence of vertices that are connected by
    edges. Formally we would define a path as
    :math:`w_1, w_2, ..., w_n` such that
    :math:`(w_i, w_{i+1}) \in E` for all :math:`1 \le i \le n-1`.
    The unweighted path length is the number of edges in the path,
    specifically :math:`n-1`. The weighted path length is the sum of
    the weights of all the edges in the path. For example in
    :ref:`Figure 2 <fig_dgsimple>` the path from :math:`v_3` to :math:`v_1` is
    the sequence of vertices :math:`(v_3, v_4, v_0, v_1)`. The edges are
    :math:`\left\{(v_3, v_4, 7), (v_4, v_0, 1), (v_0, v_1, 5) \right\}`.

Cycle
    A **cycle** in a directed graph is a path that starts and ends at the
    same vertex. For example, in :ref:`Figure 2 <fig_dgsimple>` the path
    :math:`(v_5, v_2, v_3, v_5)` is a cycle. A graph with no cycles is called
    an **acyclic graph**. A directed graph with no cycles is called a
    **directed acyclic graph** or a **DAG**. We will see that we can
    solve several important problems if the problem can be represented
    as a DAG.
