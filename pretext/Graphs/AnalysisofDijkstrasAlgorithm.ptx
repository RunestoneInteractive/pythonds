  <title>Analysis of Dijkstra's Algorithm</title>
  <p>Finally, let's look at the running time of Dijkstra's algorithm. We
            first note that building the priority queue takes <math>O(|V|)</math> time
            since we initially add every vertex in the graph to the priority queue.
            Once the queue is constructed, the <c>while</c> loop
            is executed once for every vertex since vertices are all added at the
            beginning and only removed after that. Within that loop each call to
            <c>delete</c> takes <math>O(\log{|V|})</math> time. Taken together, that part of
            the loop and the calls to <c>delete</c> take <math>O(|V| \times \log{|V|})</math>. The
            <c>for</c> loop is executed once for each edge in the
            graph, and within the <c>for</c> loop the call to <c>change_priority</c> takes
            <math>O(|E| \times \log{|V|})</math> time. So the combined running time is
            <math>O((|V|+|E|) \times \log{|V|}).</math></p>
