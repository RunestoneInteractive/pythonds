  <title>Analysis of Dijkstra's Algorithm</title>
  <p>Finally, let's look at the running time of Dijkstra's algorithm. We
            first note that building the priority queue takes <m>O(|V|)</m> time
            since we initially add every vertex in the graph to the priority queue.
            Once the queue is constructed, the <c>while</c> loop
            is executed once for every vertex since vertices are all added at the
            beginning and only removed after that. Within that loop each call to
            <c>delete</c> takes <m>O(\log{|V|})</m> time. Taken together, that part of
            the loop and the calls to <c>delete</c> take <m>O(|V| \times \log{|V|})</m>. The
            <c>for</c> loop is executed once for each edge in the
            graph, and within the <c>for</c> loop the call to <c>change_priority</c> takes
            <m>O(|E| \times \log{|V|})</m> time. So the combined running time is
            <m>O((|V|+|E|) \times \log{|V|}).</m></p>
