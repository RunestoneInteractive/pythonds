  <title>Depth-First Search Analysis</title>
  <p>The general running time for depth-first search is as follows. The loops
            in <c>dfs</c> both run in <math>O(|V|)</math>,
            not counting what happens in <c>dfs_visit</c>, since they are executed once
            for each vertex in the graph. In <c>dfs_visit</c> the loop is executed once
            for each edge in the adjacency list of the current vertex.
            Since <c>dfs_visit</c> is only called
            recursively if the vertex is white, the loop will execute a maximum of
            once for every edge in the graph, or <math>O(|E|)</math>. Therefore, the total time
            for depth-first search is <math>O(|V| + |E|)</math>.</p>
