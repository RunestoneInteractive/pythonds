  <title>Vocabulary and Definitions</title>
  <p>Now that we have looked at an graph, we will more
            formally define a graph and its components. We already know some of
            these terms from our discussion of trees.</p>
  <dl>
    <li>
      <title>Vertex</title>
      <p>A <term>vertex</term> (also called a <em>node</em>) is a fundamental part of a graph. It
                        can have a name, which we will call the <em>key</em>. A vertex may also
                        have additional information. We will call this additional
                        information the <em>value</em> or the <em>payload</em>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>Edge</title>
      <p>An <term>edge</term> (also called an <em>arc</em>) is another fundamental part of a
                        graph. An edge connects two vertices to show that there is a
                        relationship between them. Edges may be one-way or two-way. If the
                        edges in a graph are all one-way, we say that the graph is a
                        <term>directed graph</term>, or a <term>digraph</term>. The class prerequisites graph
                        shown above is clearly a digraph since you must take some classes
                        before others.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>Weight</title>
      <p>Edges may be <term>weighted</term> to show that there is a cost to go from one
                        vertex to another, which we call <term>edge cost</term>.
                        For example, in a graph of roads that connect one
                        city to another, the weight on the edge might represent the distance
                        between the two cities.</p>
    </li>
  </dl>
  <p>With those definitions in hand, we can formally define a graph. A graph
            can be represented by <m>G</m> where <m>G =(V,E)</m>. For the
            graph <m>G</m>, <m>V</m> is a set of vertices and <m>E</m> is a
            set of edges. Each edge is a tuple <m>(v, w)</m> where
            <m>v, w \in V</m>. We can add a third component to the edge tuple to
            represent a weight. A subgraph <m>s</m> is a set of edges <m>e</m>
            and vertices <m>v</m> such that <m>e \subset E</m> and
            <m>v \subset V</m>.</p>
  <p><xref ref="i188_id1fig-dgsimple"/> shows another example of a simple weighted
            digraph. Formally we can represent this graph as the set of six
            vertices:</p>
  <math_block docname="Graphs/VocabularyandDefinitions"  nowrap="False" number="True" xml:space="preserve">V = \left\{ v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5 \right\}</math_block>
  <p>and the set of nine edges:</p>
  <math_block docname="Graphs/VocabularyandDefinitions"  nowrap="False" number="True" xml:space="preserve">E = \left\{ \begin{array}{l}(v_0, v_1, 5), (v_1, v_2, 4), (v_2, v_3, 9), \\
                             (v_3, v_4, 7), (v_4, v_0, 1), (v_0, v_5, 2), \\
                             (v_5, v_4, 8), (v_3, v_5, 3), (v_5, v_2, 1)
             \end{array} \right\}</math_block>

  <p>The example graph in <xref ref="i188_id1fig-dgsimple"/> helps illustrate two other
            key graph terms:</p>
  <dl>
    <li>
      <title>Path</title>
      <p>A <term>path</term> in a graph is a sequence of vertices that are connected by
                        edges. Formally we would define a path as
                        <m>w_1, w_2, ..., w_n</m> such that
                        <m>(w_i, w_{i+1}) \in E</m> for all <m>1 \le i \le n-1</m>.
                        The unweighted path length is the number of edges in the path,
                        specifically <m>n-1</m>. The weighted path length is the sum of
                        the weights of all the edges in the path. For example in
                        <xref ref="i188_id1fig-dgsimple"/> the path from <m>v_3</m> to <m>v_1</m> is
                        the sequence of vertices <m>(v_3, v_4, v_0, v_1)</m>. The edges are
                        <m>\left\{(v_3, v_4, 7), (v_4, v_0, 1), (v_0, v_1, 5) \right\}</m>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>Cycle</title>
      <p>A <term>cycle</term> in a directed graph is a path that starts and ends at the
                        same vertex. For example, in <xref ref="i188_id1fig-dgsimple"/> the path
                        <m>(v_5, v_2, v_3, v_5)</m> is a cycle. A graph with no cycles is called
                        an <term>acyclic graph</term>. A directed graph with no cycles is called a
                        <term>directed acyclic graph</term> or a <term>DAG</term>. We will see that we can
                        solve several important problems if the problem can be represented
                        as a DAG.</p>
