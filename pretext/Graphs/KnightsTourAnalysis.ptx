  <title>Knight's Tour Analysis</title>
  <p>There is one last interesting topic regarding the knight's tour problem,
            then we will move on to the general version of the depth-first search.
            The topic is performance. In particular, <c>knight_tour</c> is very
            sensitive to the method you use to select the next vertex to visit. For
            example, on a <m>5 \times 5</m> board you can produce a path in about 1.5
            seconds on a reasonably fast computer. But what happens if you try an
            <m>8 \times 8</m> board? In this case, depending on the speed of your
            computer, you may have to wait up to a half hour to get the results! The
            reason for this is that the knight's tour problem as we have implemented
            it so far is an exponential algorithm of size <m>O(k^N)</m>, where <m>N</m>
            is the number of squares on the chess board, and <m>k</m> is a small constant.
            <xref ref="i178_id1fig-8array"/> can help us visualize why this is so. The root of
            the tree represents the starting point of the search. From there the
            algorithm generates and checks each of the possible moves the knight can
            make. As we have noted before, the number of moves possible depends on
            the position of the knight on the board. In the corners there are only
            two legal moves, on the squares adjacent to the corners there are three,
            and in the middle of the board there are eight. <xref ref="i178_id2fig-nummoves"/>
            shows the number of moves possible for each position on a board. At the
            next level of the tree there are once again between two and eight possible
            next moves from the position we are currently exploring. The number of
            possible positions to examine corresponds to the number of nodes in the
            search tree.</p>

  <p>We have already seen that the number of nodes in a binary tree of height
            <m>N</m> is <m>2^{N+1}-1</m>. For a tree with nodes that may have up to
            eight children instead of two, the number of nodes is much larger.
            Because the branching factor of each node is variable, we could estimate
            the number of nodes using an average branching factor. The important
            thing to note is that this algorithm is exponential:
            <m>k^{N+1}-1</m>, where <m>k</m> is the average branching factor
            for the board. Let's look at how rapidly this grows! For a board that is
            <m>5 \times 5</m> the tree will be 25 levels deep, or <m>N = 24</m> counting the first level
            as level 0. The average branching factor is <m>k = 3.8</m> so the
            number of nodes in the search tree is <m>3.8^{25}-1</m> or
            <m>3.12 \times 10^{14}</m>. For a <m>6 \times 6</m> board, <m>k = 4.4</m>, there
            are <m>1.5 \times 10^{23}</m> nodes, and for a regular <m>8 \times 8</m> chess board,
            <m>k = 5.25</m>, there are <m>1.3 \times 10^{46}</m>. Of course,
            since there are multiple solutions to the problem we won't have to
            explore every single node, but the fractional part of the nodes we do
            have to explore is just a constant multiplier which does not change the
            exponential nature of the problem. We will leave it as an exercise for
            you to see if you can express <m>k</m> as a function of the board
            size.</p>
  <p>Luckily there is a way to speed up the <m>8 \times 8</m> case so that it
            runs in under one second. In the <xref ref="graphs_lst-avail"/> we show the code that
            speeds up the <c>knight_tour</c>. This function, called <c>order_by_avail</c>,
            will be used in place of the call to <c>u.get_neighbors</c> at line 8 in <xref ref="graphs_implementing-knights-tour"/>.
            The critical line in the
            <c>order_by_avail</c> function is line 10. This line ensures that we select the vertex
            that has the fewest available moves to go next. You
            might think this is really counterproductive; why not select the node
            that has the most available moves? You can try that approach easily by
            running the program yourself and inserting the line
            <c>res_list.reverse()</c> right after the sort.</p>
  <p>The problem with using the vertex with the most available moves as your
            next vertex on the path is that it tends to have the knight visit the
            middle squares early on in the tour. When this happens it is easy for
            the knight to get stranded on one side of the board where it cannot
            reach unvisited squares on the other side of the board. On the other
            hand, visiting the squares with the fewest available moves first pushes
            the knight to visit the squares around the edges of the board first.
            This ensures that the knight will visit the hard-to-reach corners early
            and can use the middle squares to hop across the board only when
            necessary.</p>
  <p>Utilizing this kind of knowledge to speed up an algorithm is
            called a <em>heuristic</em>. Humans use heuristics every day to help make
            decisions, and heuristic searches are often used in the field of artificial
            intelligence. This particular heuristic is called Warnsdorff's
            algorithm, named after H. C. von Warnsdorff who published his idea in 1823.</p>
