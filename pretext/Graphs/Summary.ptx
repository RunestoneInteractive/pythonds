  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>In this chapter we have looked at the graph abstract data type and some
            implementations of a graph. A graph enables us to solve many problems&#x2014;
            provided we can transform the original problem into something that can
            be represented by a graph. In particular, we have seen that graphs are
            useful to solve problems in the following general areas:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Breadth-first search for finding the unweighted shortest path.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Dijkstra's algorithm for the weighted shortest path.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Depth-first search for graph exploration.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Strongly connected components for simplifying a graph.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Topological sort for ordering tasks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Minimum weight spanning trees for broadcasting messages.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
