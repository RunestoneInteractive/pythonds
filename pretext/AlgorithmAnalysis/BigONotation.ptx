  <title>Big O Notation</title>
  <p>When trying to characterize an algorithm's efficiency in terms of
            execution time, independent of any particular program or computer, it is
            important to quantify the number of operations or steps that the
            algorithm will require. If each of these steps is considered to be a
            basic unit of computation, then the execution time for an algorithm can
            be expressed as the number of steps required to solve the problem.
            Deciding on an appropriate basic unit of computation can be a
            complicated problem and will depend on how the algorithm is implemented.</p>
  <p>A good basic unit of computation for comparing the summation algorithms
            shown earlier might be the number of assignment statements
            performed to compute the sum. In the function <c>sum_of_n</c>, the number of
            assignment statements is 1 (<math>the\_sum = 0</math>)
            plus the value of <em>n</em> (the number of times we perform
            <math>the\_sum = the\_sum + i</math>). We can denote this by a function, call it <math>T</math>,
            where <math>T(n) = 1 + n</math>. The parameter <em>n</em> is often referred to as
            the <q>size of the problem,</q> and we can read this as <q><math>T(n)</math> is the time
            it takes to solve a problem of size <math>n</math>, namely <math>1 + n</math> steps.</q></p>
  <p>In the summation functions given above, it makes sense to use the number
            of terms in the summation to denote the size of the problem. We can then
            say that the sum of the first 100,000 integers is a bigger instance of
            the summation problem than the sum of the first 1,000. Because of this,
            it might seem reasonable that the time required to solve the larger case
            would be greater than for the smaller case. Our goal then is to show how
            the algorithm's execution time changes with respect to the size of the
            problem.</p>
  <p>Computer scientists prefer to take this analysis technique one step
            further. It turns out that the exact number of operations is not as
            important as determining the most dominant part of the <math>T(n)</math>
            function. In other words, as the problem gets larger, some portion of
            the <math>T(n)</math> function tends to overpower the rest. This dominant
            term is what, in the end, is used for comparison. The <term>order of
                magnitude</term> function describes the part of <math>T(n)</math> that increases
            the fastest as the value of <em>n</em> increases. Order of magnitude is often
            called <term>Big O notation</term> (for <em>order</em>) and written as
            <math>O(f(n))</math>. It provides a useful approximation of the actual
            number of steps in the computation. The function <math>f(n)</math> provides
            a simple representation of the dominant part of the original
            <math>T(n)</math>.</p>
  <p>In the above example, <math>T(n) = 1 + n</math>. As <em>n</em> gets larger, the
            constant 1 will become less and less significant to the final result. If
            we are looking for an approximation for <math>T(n)</math>, then we can drop
            the 1 and simply say that the running time is <math>O(n)</math>. It is
            important to note that the 1 is certainly significant for
            <math>T(n)</math>. However, as <em>n</em> gets large, our approximation will be
            just as accurate without it.</p>
  <p>As another example, suppose that for some algorithm, the exact number of
            steps is <math>T(n)=5n^{2} + 27n + 1005</math>. When <em>n</em> is small, say 1 or 2,
            the constant 1005 seems to be the dominant part of the function.
            However, as <em>n</em> gets larger, the <math>n^{2}</math> term becomes the most
            important. In fact, when <em>n</em> is really large, the other two terms become
            insignificant in the role that they play in determining the final
            result. Again, to approximate <math>T(n)</math> as <em>n</em> gets large, we can
            ignore the other terms and focus on <math>5n^{2}</math>. In addition, the
            coefficient <math>5</math> becomes insignificant as <em>n</em> gets large. We
            would say then that the function <math>T(n)</math> has an order of
            magnitude <math>f(n) = n^{2}</math>, or simply that it is <math>O(n^{2})</math>.</p>
  <p>Although we do not see this in the summation example, sometimes the
            performance of an algorithm depends on the exact values of the data
            rather than simply the size of the problem. For these kinds of
            algorithms we need to characterize their performance in terms of <term>best-case</term>,
            <term>worst-case</term>, or <term>average-case</term> performance. The worst-case
            performance refers to a particular data set where the algorithm performs
            especially poorly, whereas a different data set for
            the exact same algorithm might have extraordinarily good (best-case) performance.
            However, in most cases the algorithm performs somewhere in between these
            two extremes (average-case performance). It is important for a computer scientist to understand
            these distinctions so they are not misled by one particular case.</p>
  <p>A number of very common order of magnitude functions will come up over
            and over as you study algorithms. These are shown in <xref ref="algorithm-analysis_algorithm-analysis_tbl-fntable"/>. In
            order to decide which of these functions is the dominant part of any
            <math>T(n)</math> function, we must see how they compare with one another
            as <em>n</em> gets large.</p>

  <p><xref ref="fig-graphfigure"/> shows graphs of the common
            functions from <xref ref="algorithm-analysis_algorithm-analysis_tbl-fntable"/>. Notice that when <em>n</em> is small, the
            functions are not very well defined with respect to one another. It is
            hard to tell which is dominant. However, as <em>n</em> grows, there is a
            definite relationship and it is easy to see how they compare with one
            another.</p>

  <p>As a final example, suppose that we have the fragment of Python code
            shown in <xref ref="lst-dummycode"/>. Although this program does not really do
            anything, it is instructive to see how we can take actual code and
            analyze performance.</p>

  <pre>a = 5
b = 6
c = 10
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        x = i * i
        y = j * j
        z = i * j
for k in range(n):
    w = a * k + 45
    v = b * b
d = 33</pre>
  <p>The number of assignment operations is the sum of four terms. The first
            term is the constant 3, representing the three assignment statements at
            the start of the fragment. The second term is <math>3n^{2}</math>, since
            there are three statements that are performed <math>n^{2}</math> times due
            to the nested iteration. The third term is <math>2n</math>, two statements
            iterated <em>n</em> times. Finally, the fourth term is the constant 1,
            representing the final assignment statement. This gives us
            <math>T(n) = 3 + 3n^{2} + 2n + 1 = 3n^{2} + 2n + 4</math>. By looking at the exponents,
            we can easily see that the <math>n^{2}</math> term will be dominant and
            therefore this fragment of code is <math>O(n^{2})</math>. Note that all of
            the other terms as well as the coefficient on the dominant term can be
            ignored as <em>n</em> grows larger.</p>

  <p><xref ref="fig-graphfigure2"/> shows a few of the common Big O functions as they
            compare with the <math>T(n)</math> function discussed above. Note that
            <math>T(n)</math> is initially larger than the cubic function. However, as
            n grows, the cubic function quickly overtakes <math>T(n)</math>. It is easy
            to see that <math>T(n)</math> then follows the quadratic function as
