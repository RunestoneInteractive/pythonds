  <title>Lists</title>
  <p>The designers of Python had many choices to make when they implemented
            the list data structure. Each of these choices could have an impact on
            how fast list operations perform. To help them make the right choices
            they looked at the ways that people would most commonly use the list
            data structure, and they optimized their implementation of a list so that
            the most common operations were very fast. Of course they also tried to
            make the less common operations fast, but when a trade-off had to be made
            the performance of a less common operation was often sacrificed in favor
            of the more common operation.</p>
  <p>Two common operations are indexing and assigning to an index position.
            Both of these operations take the same amount of time no matter how
            large the list becomes. When an operation like this is independent of
            the size of the list, it is <m>O(1)</m>.</p>
  <p>Another very common programming task is to grow a list. There are two
            ways to create a longer list.  You can use the <c>append</c> method or the
            concatenation operator. The <c>append</c> method is <m>O(1)</m>. However,
            the concatenation operator is <m>O(k)</m> where <m>k</m> is the
            size of the list that is being concatenated. This is important for you
            to know because it can help you make your own programs more efficient by
            choosing the right tool for the job.</p>
  <p>Let's look at four different ways we might generate a list of <c>n</c>
            numbers starting with 0. First we'll try a <c>for</c> loop and create the
            list by concatenation, then we'll use <c>append</c> rather than concatenation.
            Next, we'll try creating the list using list comprehension and finally,
            and perhaps the most obvious way, using the range function wrapped by a
            call to the list constructor. <xref ref="algorithm-analysis_lst-mklist"/> shows the code for
            making our list four different ways.</p>
  <listing xml:id="algorithm-analysis_lst-mklist"><pre>def test1():
    l = []
    for i in range(1000):
        l = l + [i]


def test2():
    l = []
    for i in range(1000):
        l.append(i)


def test3():
    l = [i for i in range(1000)]


def test4():
    l = list(range(1000))</pre></listing>
  <p>To capture the time it takes for each of our functions to execute we
            will use Python's <c>timeit</c> module. The <c>timeit</c> module is designed
            to allow Python developers to make cross-platform timing measurements by
            running functions in a consistent environment and using timing
            mechanisms that are as similar as possible across operating systems.</p>
  <p>To use <c>timeit</c> you create a <c>Timer</c> object whose parameters are two
            Python statements. The first parameter is a Python statement that you
            want to time; the second parameter is a statement that will run once to
            set up the test. The <c>timeit</c> module will then time how long it takes
            to execute the statement some number of times. By default <c>timeit</c>
            will try to run the statement one million times. When it's done it
            returns the time as a floating-point value representing the total number
            of seconds. However, since it executes the statement a million times, you
            can read the result as the number of microseconds to execute the test
            one time. You can also pass <c>timeit</c> a named parameter called
            <c>number</c> that allows you to specify how many times the test statement
            is executed. The following session shows how long it takes to run each
            of our test functions a thousand times.</p>
  <pre>from timeit import Timer


t1 = Timer("test1()", "from __main__ import test1")
print(f"concatenation: {t1.timeit(number=1000):15.2f} milliseconds")
t2 = Timer("test2()", "from __main__ import test2")
print(f"appending: {t2.timeit(number=1000):19.2f} milliseconds")
t3 = Timer("test3()", "from __main__ import test3")
print(f"list comprehension: {t3.timeit(number=1000):10.2f} milliseconds")
t4 = Timer("test4()", "from __main__ import test4")
print(f"list range: {t4.timeit(number=1000):18.2f} milliseconds")

concatenation:           6.54 milliseconds
appending:               0.31 milliseconds
list comprehension:      0.15 milliseconds
list range:              0.07 milliseconds</pre>
  <p>In the experiment above the statement that we are timing is the function
            call to <c>test1()</c>, <c>test2()</c>, and so on. The setup statement may
            look very strange to you, so let's consider it in more detail. You are
            probably very familiar with the <c>from...import</c> statement, but this
            is usually used at the beginning of a Python program file. In this case
            the statement <c>from __main__ import test1</c> imports the function
            <c>test1</c> from the <c>__main__</c> namespace into the namespace that
            <c>timeit</c> sets up for the timing experiment. The <c>timeit</c> module does
            this because it wants to run the timing tests in an environment that is
            uncluttered by any stray variables you may have created that may
            interfere with your function's performance in some unforeseen way.</p>
  <p>From the experiment above it is clear that the <c>append</c> operation at 0.31
            milliseconds is much faster than concatenation at 6.54 milliseconds.
            We also show the times for two additional methods
            for creating a list: using the list constructor with a call to <c>range</c>
            and a list comprehension. It is interesting to note that the list
            comprehension is twice as fast as a <c>for</c> loop with an <c>append</c>
            operation.</p>
  <p>One final observation about this little experiment is that all of the
            times that you see above include some overhead for actually calling the
            test function, but we can assume that the function call overhead is
            identical in all four cases so we still get a meaningful comparison of
            the operations. So it would not be accurate to say that the
            concatenation operation takes 6.54 milliseconds but rather the
            concatenation test function takes 6.54 milliseconds. As an exercise you
            could test the time it takes to call an empty function and subtract that
            from the numbers above.</p>
  <p>Now that we have seen how performance can be measured concretely, you can
            look at <xref ref="algorithm-analysis_algorithm-analysis_algorithm-analysis_tbl-listbigo"/> to see the Big O efficiency of all the
            basic list operations. After thinking carefully about
            <xref ref="algorithm-analysis_algorithm-analysis_algorithm-analysis_tbl-listbigo"/>, you may be wondering about the two different times
            for <c>pop</c>. When <c>pop</c> is called on the end of the list it takes
            <m>O(1)</m>, but when <c>pop</c> is called on the first element in the list&#x2014;or anywhere in the middle it&#x2014;is <m>O(n)</m>
            The reason for this lies
            in how Python chooses to implement lists. When an item is taken from the
            front of the list, all the other elements in
            the list are shifted one position closer to the beginning. This may seem
            silly to you now, but if you look at <xref ref="algorithm-analysis_algorithm-analysis_algorithm-analysis_tbl-listbigo"/> you will see
            that this implementation also allows the index operation to be
            <m>O(1)</m>. This is a tradeoff that the Python designers thought
            was a good one.</p>

  <p>As a way of demonstrating this difference in performance, let's do
            another experiment using the <c>timeit</c> module. Our goal is to be able
            to verify the performance of the <c>pop</c> operation on a list of a known
            size when the program pops from the end of the list, and again when the
            program pops from the beginning of the list. We will also want to
            measure this time for lists of different sizes. What we would expect to
            see is that the time required to pop from the end of the list will stay
            constant even as the list grows in size, while the time to pop from the
            beginning of the list will continue to increase as the list grows.</p>
  <p><xref ref="algorithm-analysis_lst-popmeas"/> shows one attempt to measure the difference
            between the two uses of <c>pop</c>. As you can see from this first example,
            popping from the end takes 0.00014 milliseconds, whereas popping from the
            beginning takes 2.09779 milliseconds. For a list of two million elements
            this is a factor of 15,000.</p>
  <p>There are a couple of things to notice about <xref ref="algorithm-analysis_lst-popmeas"/>. The
            first is the statement <c>from __main__ import x</c>. Although we did not
            define a function, we do want to be able to use the list object x in our
            test. This approach allows us to time just the single <c>pop</c> statement
            and get the most accurate measure of the time for that single operation.
            Because the timer repeats a thousand times, it is also important to point out
            that the list is decreasing in size by one each time through the loop. But
            since the initial list is two million elements in size, we only reduce
            the overall size by <m>0.05\%</m>.</p>
  <listing xml:id="algorithm-analysis_lst-popmeas"><pre>pop_zero = Timer("x.pop(0)", "from __main__ import x")
pop_end = Timer("x.pop()", "from __main__ import x")

x = list(range(2000000))
print(f"pop(0): {pop_zero.timeit(number=1000):10.5f} milliseconds")

x = list(range(2000000))
print(f"pop(): {pop_end.timeit(number=1000):11.5f} milliseconds")

pop(0):    2.09779 milliseconds
pop():     0.00014 milliseconds</pre></listing>
  <p>While our first test does show that <c>pop(0)</c> is indeed slower than
            <c>pop()</c>, it does not validate the claim that <c>pop(0)</c> is
            <m>O(n)</m> while <c>pop()</c> is <m>O(1)</m>. To validate that claim
            we need to look at the performance of both calls over a range of list
            sizes. <xref ref="algorithm-analysis_lst-poplists"/> implements this test.</p>
  <listing xml:id="algorithm-analysis_lst-poplists"><pre>pop_zero = Timer("x.pop(0)", "from __main__ import x")
pop_end = Timer("x.pop()", "from __main__ import x")
print(f"{'n':10s}{'pop(0)':&gt;15s}{'pop()':&gt;15s}")
for i in range(1_000_000, 100_000_001, 1_000_000):
    x = list(range(i))
    pop_zero_t = pop_zero.timeit(number=1000)
    x = list(range(i))
    pop_end_t = pop_end.timeit(number=1000)
    print(f"{i:&lt;10d}{pop_zero_t:&gt;15.5f}{pop_end_t:&gt;15.5f}")</pre></listing>
  <p><xref ref="i15_id2fig-poptest"/> shows the results of our experiment. You can see
            that as the list gets longer and longer the time it takes to <c>pop(0)</c>
            also increases while the time for <c>pop</c> stays very flat. This is
            exactly what we would expect to see for an <m>O(n)</m> and
            <m>O(1)</m> algorithm.</p>

  <p>Among the sources of error in our little experiment is the fact that
            there are other processes running on the computer as we measure that may
            slow down our code, so even though we try to minimize other things
            happening on the computer there is bound to be some variation in time.
            That is why the loop runs the test one thousand times in the first place
            to statistically gather enough information to make the measurement
            reliable.</p>
