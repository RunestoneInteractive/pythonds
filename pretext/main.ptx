    There are many people who have helped us to complete this book.
    Thanks to our Computer Science colleague Steve Hubbard who provided
    substantial feedback on the first edition and on the new material for
    this edition. Thanks to our colleagues around the country who sent
    helpful emails kindly pointing out mistakes in the first edition and
    suggesting topics for this new edition.
    </p><p>
    Thanks to our friends Mary, Bob, and the rest of the crew at Java
    John's in Decorah for allowing us to become ``authors in residence''
    during Brad's sabbatical.  Somehow David managed to make it through
    all those months in the coffee shop without becoming a coffee drinker.
    And yes, we acknowledge the irony of writing a Python book in
    Java Johns.

    Thanks to the staff at Franklin, Beedle, and Associates, especially
    Jim Leisy and Tom Sumner.  They were great to work with.  And finally,
    special thanks goes to our wives, Jane Miller, Brenda Ranum, and Nataliya Yasinovska.  Their
    love and support helped make this book a reality.
