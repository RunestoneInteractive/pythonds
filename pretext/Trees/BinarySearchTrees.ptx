  <title>Binary Search Trees</title>
  <p>We have already seen two different ways to get key-value pairs in a
            collection. Recall that these collections implement the <term>map</term> abstract
            data type. The two implementations of the map ADT that we have discussed were binary
            search on a list and hash tables. In this section we will study <term>binary
                search trees</term> as yet another way to map from a key to a value. In this
            case we are not interested in the exact placement of items in the tree,
            but we are interested in using the binary tree structure to provide for
            efficient searching.</p>
