        <title>Balanced Binary Search Trees</title>
        <p>In the previous section we looked at building a binary search tree. As
            we learned, the performance of the binary search tree can degrade to
            <math>O(n)</math> for operations like <c>get</c> and <c>put</c> when the tree
            becomes unbalanced. In this section we will look at a special kind of
            binary search tree that automatically makes sure that the tree remains
            balanced at all times. This tree is called an <term>AVL tree</term> and is named
            for its inventors: G.M. Adelson-Velskii and E.M. Landis.</p>
        <p>An AVL tree implements the Map abstract data type just like a regular
            binary search tree; the only difference is in how the tree performs. To
            implement our AVL tree we need to keep track of a <term>balance factor</term> for
            each node in the tree. We do this by looking at the heights of the left
            and right subtrees for each node. More formally, we define the balance
            factor for a node as the difference between the height of the left
            subtree and the height of the right subtree.</p>
        <math_block docname="Trees/BalancedBinarySearchTrees" label="True" nowrap="False" number="True" xml:space="preserve">balance\_factor = height(left\_subtree) - height(right\_subtree)</math_block>
        <p>Using the definition for balance factor given above, we say that a
            subtree is left-heavy if the balance factor is greater than zero. If the
            balance factor is less than zero, then the subtree is right-heavy. If the
            balance factor is zero, then the tree is perfectly in balance. For
            purposes of implementing an AVL tree and gaining the benefit of having
            a balanced tree, we will define a tree to be in balance if the balance
            factor is -1, 0, or 1. Once the balance factor of a node in a tree is
            outside this range we will need to have a procedure to bring the tree
            back into balance. <xref ref="fig-unbal"/> shows an example of an unbalanced
            right-heavy tree and the balance factors of each node.</p>
