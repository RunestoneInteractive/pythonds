  <title>Searching</title>
  <p>We will now turn our attention to some of the most common problems that
            arise in computing, those of searching and sorting. In this section we
            will study searching. We will return to sorting later in the chapter.
            Searching is the algorithmic process of finding a particular item in a
            collection of items. A search typically returns either <c>True</c> or
            <c>False</c> when queried on whether an item is present. On occasion a search may be
            modified to return where the item is found. For our purposes here, we
            will simply concern ourselves with the question of membership.</p>
  <p>In Python, there is a very easy way to ask whether an item is in a list
            of items. We use the <c>in</c> operator.</p>
  <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; 15 in [3, 5, 2, 4, 1]
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 in [3, 5, 2, 4, 1]
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>
  <p>Even though this is easy to write, an underlying process must be carried
            out to answer the question. It turns out that there are many different
            ways to search for the item. What we are interested in here is how these
            algorithms work and how they compare to one another.</p>
