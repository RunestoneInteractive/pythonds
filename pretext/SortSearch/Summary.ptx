        <p>A sequential search is <m>O(n)</m> for ordered and unordered
                    lists.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A binary search of an ordered list is <m>O(\log{n})</m> in the
                    worst case.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Hash tables can provide constant time searching.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A bubble sort, a selection sort, and an insertion sort are
                    <m>O(n^{2})</m> algorithms.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A Shell sort improves on the insertion sort by sorting incremental
                    sublists. It falls between <m>O(n)</m> and <m>O(n^{2})</m>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A merge sort is <m>O(n \log{n})</m>, but requires additional space
                    for the merging process.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A quicksort is <m>O(n \log{n})</m>, but may degrade to
                    <m>O(n^{2})</m> if the split points are not near the middle of the
                    list. It does not require additional space.</p>
