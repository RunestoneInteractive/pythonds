  <title>Hashing</title>
  <p>In previous sections we were able to make improvements in our search
            algorithms by taking advantage of information about where items are
            stored in the collection with respect to one another. For example, by
            knowing that a list was ordered, we could search in logarithmic time
            using a binary search. In this section we will attempt to go one step
            further by building a data structure that can be searched in
            <m>O(1)</m> time. This concept is referred to as <term>hashing</term>.</p>
  <p>In order to do this, we will need to know even more about where the
            items might be when we go to look for them in the collection. If every
            item is where it should be, then the search can use a single comparison
            to discover the presence of an item. We will see, however, that this is
            typically not the case.</p>
  <p>A <term>hash table</term> is a collection of items which are stored in such a way
            as to make it easy to find them later. Each position of the hash table,
            often called a <term>slot</term>, can hold an item and is named by an integer
            value starting at 0. For example, we will have a slot named 0, a slot
            named 1, a slot named 2, and so on. Initially, the hash table contains
            no items so every slot is empty. We can implement a hash table by using
            a list with each element initialized to the special Python value
            <c>None</c>. <xref ref="i17_id1fig-hashtable1"/> shows a hash table of size <m>m = 11</m>.
            In other words, there are <m>m</m> slots in the table, named 0 through 10.</p>

  <p>The mapping between an item and the slot where that item belongs in the
            hash table is called the <term>hash function</term>. The hash function will take
            any item in the collection and return an integer in the range of slot
            names between 0 and <m>m - 1</m>. Assume that we have the set of integer items
            54, 26, 93, 17, 77, and 31. Our first hash function, sometimes referred
            to as the <em>remainder method</em>, simply takes an item and divides it by the
            table size, returning the remainder as its hash value
            (<m>h(item)=item \% 11</m>). <xref ref="sort-search_sort-search_tbl-hashvalues1"/> gives all of the
            hash values for our example items. Note that this remainder method
            (modulo) will typically be present in some form in all hash
            functions since the result must be in the range of slot names.</p>

  <p>Once the hash values have been computed, we can insert each item into
            the hash table at the designated position as shown in
            <xref ref="fig-hashtable2"/>. Note that 6 of the 11 slots are now occupied. This
            is referred to as the <term>load factor</term>, and is commonly denoted by
            <m>\lambda = \frac {number\_of\_items}{table\_size}</m>. For this example,
            <m>\lambda = \frac {6}{11}</m>.</p>

    <image source="SortSearch/Figures/hashtable2.png" width="50%"/>
  </figure>
  <p>Now when we want to search for an item, we simply use the hash function
            to compute the slot name for the item and then check the hash table to
            see if it is present. This searching operation is <m>O(1)</m> since
            a constant amount of time is required to compute the hash value and then
            index the hash table at that location. If everything is where it should
            be, we have found a constant time search algorithm.</p>
  <p>You can probably already see that this technique is going to work only
            if each item maps to a unique location in the hash table. For example,
            if the item 44 had been the next item in our collection, it would have a
            hash value of 0 (<m>44\ \%\ 11 = 0</m>). Since 77 also had a hash
            value of 0, we would have a problem. According to the hash function, two
            or more items would need to be in the same slot. This is referred to as
            a <term>collision</term> (it may also be called a <em>clash</em>). Clearly, collisions
            create a problem for the hashing technique. We will discuss them in
            detail later.</p>
  <subsection xml:id="sort-search_hash-functions">
    <title>Hash Functions</title>
    <p>Given a collection of items, a hash function that maps each item into a
                unique slot is referred to as a <term>perfect hash function</term>. If we know
                the items and the collection will never change, then it is possible to
                construct a perfect hash function. Unfortunately, given an arbitrary collection of
                items, there is no systematic way to construct a perfect hash function.
                Luckily, we do not need the hash function to be perfect to still gain
                performance efficiency.</p>
    <p>One way to always have a perfect hash function is to increase the size
                of the hash table so that each possible value in the item range can be
                accommodated. This guarantees that each item will have a unique slot.
                Although this is practical for small numbers of items, it is not
                feasible when the number of possible items is large. For example, if the
                items were nine-digit Social Security numbers, this method would require
                almost one billion slots. If we only want to store data for a class of
                25 students, we will be wasting an enormous amount of memory.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to create a hash function that minimizes the number of
                collisions, is easy to compute, and evenly distributes the items in the
                hash table. To that end, there are a number of common ways to extend the simple
                remainder method. We will consider a few of them here.</p>
    <p>The <term>folding method</term> for constructing hash functions begins by
                dividing the item into equal-sized pieces (the last piece may not be of
                equal size). These pieces are then added together to give the resulting
                hash value. For example, if our item was the phone number 436-555-4601,
                we would take the digits and divide them into groups of 2
                (43, 65, 55, 46, 01). After the addition, <m>43 + 65 + 55 + 46 + 01</m>, we get
                1.   If we assume our hash table has 11 slots, then we need to perform
                the extra step of dividing by 11 and keeping the remainder. In this case
                <m>210\ \%\ 11</m> is 1, so the phone number 436-555-4601 hashes to
                slot 1. Some folding methods go one step further and reverse every other
                piece before the addition. For the above example, we get
                <m>43 + 56 + 55 + 64 + 01 = 219</m> which gives <m>219\ \%\ 11 = 10</m>.</p>
    <p>Another numerical technique for constructing a hash function is called
                the <term>mid-square method</term>. We first square the item, and then extract
                some portion of the resulting digits. For example, if the item were 44,
                we would first compute <m>44 ^{2} = 1936</m>. By extracting the
                middle two digits, 93, and performing the remainder step, we get 5
                (<m>93\ \%\ 11</m>). <xref ref="sort-search_tbl-hashvalues2"/> shows items under both the
                remainder method and the mid-square method. You should verify that you
                understand how these values were computed.</p>

    <p>We can also create hash functions for character-based items such as
                strings. For example, the word <em>cat</em> can be thought of as a sequence of ordinal
                values.</p>
    <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; ord("c")
99
&gt;&gt;&gt; ord("a")
97
&gt;&gt;&gt; ord("t")
116</pre>
    <p>We can then take these three ordinal values, add them up, and use the
                remainder method to get a hash value (see <xref ref="fig-stringhash"/>).
                <xref ref="sort-search_lst-hashfunction1"/> shows a function called <c>hash_str</c> that takes a
                string and a table size and returns the hash value in the range from 0
                to <c>table_size</c>-1.</p>

                one possible way to use the positional value as a weighting factor. The

    <p>You may be able to think of a number of additional ways to compute hash
                values for items in a collection. The important thing to remember is
                that the hash function has to be efficient so that it does not become
                the dominant part of the storage and search process. If the hash
                function is too complex, then it becomes more work to compute the slot
                name than it would be to simply do a basic sequential or binary search
                as described earlier. This would quickly defeat the purpose of hashing.</p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="sort-search_collision-resolution">
    <title>Collision Resolution</title>
    <p>We now return to the problem of collisions. When two items hash to the
                same slot, we must have a systematic method for placing the second item
                in the hash table. This process is called <term>collision resolution</term>. As
                we stated earlier, if the hash function is perfect, collisions will
                never occur. However, since this is often not possible, collision
                resolution becomes a very important part of hashing.</p>
    <p>One method for resolving collisions looks into the hash table and tries
                to find another open slot to hold the item that caused the collision. A
                simple way to do this is to start at the original hash value position
                and then move in a sequential manner through the slots until we
                encounter the first slot that is empty. Note that we may need to go back
                to the first slot (circularly) to cover the entire hash table. This
                collision resolution process is referred to as <term>open addressing</term> in
                that it tries to find the next open slot or address in the hash table.
                By systematically visiting each slot one at a time, we are performing an
                open addressing technique called <term>linear probing</term>.</p>
    <p><xref ref="fig-linearprobing"/> shows an extended set of integer items under the
                simple remainder method hash function (54, 26, 93, 17, 77, 31, 44, 55, 20).
                <xref ref="sort-search_sort-search_tbl-hashvalues1"/> above shows the hash values for the original six items and
                <xref ref="fig-hashtable2"/> shows the contents of a hash table with those six items.
                Let's see what happens when we attempt to place the additional three items into the table.
                When we attempt to
                place 44 into slot 0, a collision occurs. Under linear probing, we look
                sequentially, slot by slot, until we find an open position. In this
                case, we find slot 1.</p>
    <p>Again, 55 should go in slot 0 but must be placed in slot 2 since it is
                the next open position. The final value of 20 hashes to slot 9. Since
                slot 9 is full, we begin to do linear probing. We visit slots 10, 0, 1,
                and 2, and finally find an empty slot at position 3.</p>

    <p>Once we have built a hash table using open addressing and linear
                probing, it is essential that we utilize the same methods to search for
                items. Assume we want to look up the item 93. When we compute the hash
                value, we get 5. Looking in slot 5 reveals 93, and we can return
                <c>True</c>. What if we are looking for 20? Now the hash value is 9, and
                slot 9 is currently holding 31. We cannot simply return <c>False</c> since
                we know that there could have been collisions. We are now forced to do a
                sequential search, starting at position 10, looking until either we find
                the item 20 or we find an empty slot.</p>
    <p>A disadvantage to linear probing is the tendency for <term>clustering</term>;
                items become clustered in the table. This means that if many collisions
                occur at the same hash value, a number of surrounding slots will be
                filled by the linear probing resolution. This will have an impact on
                other items that are being inserted, as we saw when we tried to add the
                item 20 above. A cluster of values hashing to 0 had to be skipped to
                finally find an open position. This cluster is shown in
                <xref ref="fig-clustering"/>.</p>

    <p>One way to deal with clustering is to extend the linear probing
                technique so that instead of looking sequentially for the next open
                slot, we skip slots, thereby more evenly distributing the items that
                have caused collisions. This will potentially reduce the clustering that
                occurs. <xref ref="fig-linearprobing2"/> shows the items when collision
                resolution is done with what we will call a <q>plus 3</q> probe. This means that once a
                collision occurs, we will look at every third slot until we find one
                that is empty.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>The general name for this process of looking for another slot after a
                collision is <term>rehashing</term>. With simple linear probing, the rehash
                function is <m>new\_hash = rehash(old\_hash)</m> where
                <m>rehash(pos) = (pos + 1) \% size</m>. The plus 3 rehash
                can be defined as <m>rehash(pos) = (pos + 3) \% size</m>. In
                general, <m>rehash(pos) = (pos + skip) \% size</m>. It is
                important to note that the size of the skip must be such that all the
                slots in the table will eventually be visited. Otherwise, part of the
                table will be unused. To ensure this, it is often suggested that the
                table size be a prime number. This is the reason we have been using 11
                in our examples.</p>
    <p>A variation of the linear probing idea is called <term>quadratic probing</term>.
                Instead of using a constant skip value, we use a rehash function that
                increments the hash value by 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on. This means that
                if the first hash value is <m>h</m>, the successive values are <m>h + 1</m>,
                <m>h + 4</m>, <m>h + 9</m>, <m>h + 16</m>, and so on. In general, the <m>i</m> will be <m>i ^ {2}</m> and <m>rehash(pos) = (h + i ^ {2}) \% size</m>. In other words,
                quadratic probing uses a skip consisting of successive perfect squares.
                <xref ref="fig-quadratic"/> shows our example values after they are placed using
                this technique.</p>

    <p>An alternative method for handling the collision problem is to allow
                each slot to hold a reference to a collection (or chain) of items.
                <term>Chaining</term> allows many items to exist at the same location in the hash
                table. When collisions happen, the item is still placed in the proper
                slot of the hash table. As more and more items hash to the same
                location, the difficulty of searching for the item in the collection
                increases. <xref ref="fig-chaining"/> shows the items as they are added to a hash
                table that uses chaining to resolve collisions.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>When we want to search for an item, we use the hash function to generate
                the slot where it should reside. Since with chaining each slot holds a collection, we
                use a searching technique to decide whether the item is present. The
                advantage is that on the average there are likely to be many fewer items
                in each slot, so the search is perhaps more efficient. We will look at
                the analysis for hashing at the end of this section.</p>

    <title>Implementing the Map Abstract Data Type</title>
    <p>One of the most useful Python collections is the dictionary. Recall that
                a dictionary is an associative data type where you can store key-data
                pairs. The key is used to look up the associated data value. We often
                refer to this idea as a <term>map</term>.</p>
    <p>The map abstract data type is defined as follows. The structure is an
                unordered collection of associations between a key and a data value. The
                keys in a map are all unique so that there is a one-to-one relationship
                between a key and a value. The operations are given below.</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><c>Map()</c> creates a new empty map.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><c>put(key, val)</c> adds a new key&#x2013;value pair to the map. If the key is
                        already in the map, it replaces the old value with the new value.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><c>get(key)</c> takes a key and returns the matching value stored in the map or
                        <c>None</c> otherwise.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><c>del</c> deletes the key&#x2013;value pair from the map using a statement of
                        the form <c>del map[key]</c>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><c>size()</c> returns the number of key&#x2013;value pairs stored in the map.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><c>in</c> return <c>True</c> for a statement of the form <c>key in map</c> if
                        the given key is in the map, <c>False</c> otherwise.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>One of the great benefits of a dictionary is the fact that given a key,
                we can look up the associated data value very quickly. In order to
                provide this fast look-up capability, we need an implementation that
                supports an efficient search. We could use a list with sequential or
                binary search, but it would be even better to use a hash table as
                described above since looking up an item in a hash table can approach
                <m>O(1)</m> performance.</p>
    <p>In <xref ref="sort-search_lst-hashtablecodeconstructor"/> we use two lists to create a
                <c>HashTable</c> class that implements the map abstract data type. One
                list, called <c>slots</c>, will hold the key items and a parallel list,
                called <c>data</c>, will hold the data values. When we look up a key, the
                corresponding position in the data list will hold the associated data
                value. We will treat the key list as a hash table using the ideas
                presented earlier. Note that the initial size for the hash table has
                been chosen to be 11. Although this is arbitrary, it is important that
                the size be a prime number so that the collision resolution algorithm
                can be as efficient as possible.</p>
    <listing xml:id="sort-search_lst-hashtablecodeconstructor"><pre>class HashTable:
    def __init__(self):
        self.size = 11
        self.slots = [None] * self.size
        self.data = [None] * self.size</pre></listing>
    <p>As seen in <xref ref="sort-search_lst-hashtablecodestore"/>, <c>hash_function</c> implements
                the simple remainder method. The collision
                resolution technique is linear probing with a <q>plus 1</q> rehash value.
                The <c>put</c> function (see <xref ref="sort-search_lst-hashtablecodestore"/>) assumes that
                there will eventually be an empty slot unless the key is already present
                in the <c>self.slots</c>. It computes the original hash value and if that
                slot is not empty, iterates the <c>rehash</c> function until an empty slot
                occurs. If a nonempty slot already contains the key, the old data value
                is replaced with the new data value.</p>

    <p>The <c>get</c> function (see <xref ref="sort-search_lst-hashtablecodesearch"/>)
                begins by computing the initial hash value. If the value is not in the
                initial slot, <c>rehash</c> is used to locate the next possible position.
                Notice that line 14 guarantees that the search will terminate by
                checking to make sure that we have not returned to the initial slot. If
                that happens, we have exhausted all possible slots and the item must not
                be present.</p>
    <p>The final methods of the <c>HashTable</c> class provide additional
                dictionary functionality. We overload the <c>__getitem__</c> and
                <c>__setitem__</c> methods to allow access using <c>[]</c>. This means that
                once a <c>HashTable</c> has been created, the familiar index operator will
                be available. We leave the remaining methods as exercises.</p>

    <p>The following session shows the <c>HashTable</c> class in action. First we
                will create a hash table and store some items with integer keys and
                string data values.</p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
&gt;&gt;&gt; h = HashTable()
&gt;&gt;&gt; h[54] = "cat"
&gt;&gt;&gt; h[26] = "dog"
&gt;&gt;&gt; h[93] = "lion"
&gt;&gt;&gt; h[17] = "tiger"
&gt;&gt;&gt; h[77] = "bird"
&gt;&gt;&gt; h[31] = "cow"
&gt;&gt;&gt; h[44] = "goat"
&gt;&gt;&gt; h[55] = "pig"
&gt;&gt;&gt; h[20] = "chicken"
&gt;&gt;&gt; h.slots
[77, 44, 55, 20, 26, 93, 17, None, None, 31, 54]
&gt;&gt;&gt; h.data
['bird', 'goat', 'pig', 'chicken', 'dog', 'lion',
       'tiger', None, None, 'cow', 'cat']
</input>
    </program>
    <p>Next we will access and modify some items in the hash table. Note that
                the value for the key 20 is being replaced.</p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
&gt;&gt;&gt; h[20]
'chicken'
&gt;&gt;&gt; h[17]
'tiger'
&gt;&gt;&gt; h[20] = "duck"
&gt;&gt;&gt; h[20]
'duck'
&gt;&gt;&gt; h.data
['bird', 'goat', 'pig', 'duck', 'dog', 'lion',
       'tiger', None, None, 'cow', 'cat']
&gt;&gt; print(h[99])

    <title>Analysis of Hashing</title>
    <p>We stated earlier that in the best case hashing would provide an
                <m>O(1)</m>, constant time search technique. However, due to
                collisions, the number of comparisons is typically not so simple. Even
                though a complete analysis of hashing is beyond the scope of this text,
                we can state some well-known results that approximate the number of
                comparisons necessary to search for an item.</p>
    <p>The most important piece of information we need to analyze the use of a
                hash table is the load factor, <m>\lambda</m>. Conceptually, if
                <m>\lambda</m> is small, then there is a lower chance of collisions,
                meaning that items are more likely to be in the slots where they belong.
                If <m>\lambda</m> is large, meaning that the table is filling up,
                then there are more and more collisions. This means that collision
                resolution is more difficult, requiring more comparisons to find an
                empty slot. With chaining, increased collisions means an increased
                number of items on each chain.</p>
    <p>As before, we will have a result for both a successful and an
                unsuccessful search. For a successful search using open addressing with
                linear probing, the average number of comparisons is approximately
                <m>\frac{1}{2}\left(1+\frac{1}{1-\lambda}\right)</m> and an
                unsuccessful search gives
                <m>\frac{1}{2}\left(1+\left(\frac{1}{1-\lambda}\right)^2\right)</m>
                If we are using chaining, the average number of comparisons is
                <m>1 + \frac {\lambda}{2}</m> for the successful case, and simply
                <m>\lambda</m> comparisons if the search is unsuccessful.</p>
