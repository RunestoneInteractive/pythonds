  <title>Trees Revisited: Quantizing Images</title>
  <p>Next to text, digital images are the most common element found on the
            internet. However, the internet would feel much slower if every
            advertisement-sized image required 196,560&#xA0;bytes of memory. Instead, a
            banner ad image requires only 14,246, just 7.2% of what it could take.
            Where do these numbers come from? How is such a phenomenal savings
            achieved? The answers to these questions are the topic of this section.</p>

    <title>A Quick Review of Digital Images</title>
    <p>A digital image is composed of thousands of individual components called
                <term>pixels</term>. The pixels are arranged as a rectangle that forms the image.
                Each pixel in an image represents a particular color in the image. On a
                computer, the color of each pixel is determined by a mixture of three
                primary colors: red, green, and blue. A simple example of how pixels are
                arranged to form a picture is shown in Figure&#xA0;<url href="#fig_smallimage" visual="#fig_smallimage">1</url>.</p>

    <p>In the physical world colors are not discrete quantities. The colors in
                our physical world have an infinite amount of variation to them. Just as
                computers must approximate floating point numbers, they also must
                approximate the colors in an image. The human eye can distinguish
                between 200 different levels in each of the three primary colors, or a
                total of about 8 million individual colors. In practice we use one byte
                (8 bits) of memory for each color component of a pixel. Eight bits gives
                us 256 different levels for each of the red, green, and blue components,
                for a total of 16.7 million different possible colors for each pixel.
                While the huge number of colors allows artists and graphic designers to
                create wonderfully detailed images, the downside of all of these color
                possibilities is that image size grows very rapidly. For example, a
                single image from a one-megapixel camera would take 3 megabytes of
                memory.</p>
    <p>In Python we might represent an image using a list of a list of tuples,
                where the tuples consist of three numbers between 0 and 255, one for
                each of the red, green, and blue components. In other languages, such as
                C++ and Java, an image could be represented as a two-dimensional array.
                The list of lists representation of the first two rows of the image in
                Figure&#xA0;<url href="#fig_smallimage" visual="#fig_smallimage">1</url> is shown below:</p>
    <pre>im = [[(255,255,255),(255,255,255),(255,255,255),(12,28,255),
      (12,28,255),(255,255,255),(255,255,255),(255,255,255),],
      [(255,255,255),(255,255,255),(12,28,255),(255,255,255),
       (255,255,255),(12,28,255),(255,255,255),(255,255,255)],
 ... ]</pre>
    <p>The color white is represented by the tuple <math>(255, 255, 255)</math>. A bluish
                color is represented by the tuple <math>(12, 28, 255)</math>. You can obtain the color
                value for any pixel in the image by simply using list indices, for
                example:</p>
    <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; im[3][2]
(255, 18, 39)</pre>
    <p>With this representation for an image in mind, you can imagine that it
                would be easy to store an image to a file just by writing a tuple for
                each pixel. You might start by writing the number of rows and columns in
                the image and then by writing three integer values per line. In
                practice, the Python package <c>Pillow</c> provides us with some
                powerful classes. Using the <c>Image</c> class we can get and set pixels
                using <c>getpixel((col, row))</c> and <c>putpixel((col, row), color)</c>. Note
                that the parameters for the image methods are in the traditional
                <math>x, y</math> order but many people forget and think in terms of row,
                column order.</p>

    <title>Quantizing an Image</title>
    <p>There are many ways of reducing the storage requirements for an image.
                One of the easiest ways is to simply use fewer colors. Fewer color
                choices means fewer bits for each red, green, and blue component, which
                means reduced memory requirements. In fact, one of the most popular
                image formats used for images on the World Wide Web uses only 256 colors
                for an image. Using 256 colors reduces the storage requirements from
                three bytes per pixel to one byte per pixel.</p>
    <p>Right now you are probably asking yourself how to take an image that
                may have as many as 16 million colors and reduce it
                to just 256? The answer is a process called <term>quantization</term>. To
                understand the process of quantization let's think about colors as a
                three-dimensional space. Each color can be represented by a point in
                space where the red component is the <em>x</em> axis, the green component is the
                <em>y</em> axis, and the blue component is the <em>z</em> axis. We can think of the space
                of all possible colors as a <math>256 \times 256 \times 256</math> cube. The
                colors closest to the vertex at <math>(0, 0, 0)</math> are going to be black and dark
                color shades. The colors closest to the vertex at <math>(255, 255, 255)</math> are
                bright and close to white. The colors closest to <math>(255, 0, 0)</math> are red and
                so forth.</p>
    <p>The simplest way to think about quantizing an image is to imagine
                taking the <math>256 \times 256 \times 256</math> cube and turning it into an
                <math>8 \times 8 \times 8</math> cube. The overall size of the cube stays the
                same, but now many colors in the old cube are represented by a single
                color in the new cube. Figure&#xA0;<url href="#fig_colorcube" visual="#fig_colorcube">2</url> shows an example of
                the quantization just described.</p>
    <figure align="" xml:id="fig-colorcube">

    <p>We can turn this simple idea of color quantization into the Python
                program shown in Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst_simplequant" visual="#lst_simplequant">[lst_simplequant]</url>. The
                <c>simple_quant</c> algorithm works by mapping the color components for
                each pixel represented by its full 256 bits to the color at the center
                of the cube in its area. This is easy to do using integer division in
                Python. In the <c>simple_quant</c> algorithm there are seven distinct
                values in the red dimension and six distinct values in the green and
                blue dimensions.</p>
    <pre>from PIL import Image


def simple_quant(filename):
    im = Image.open(filename)
    w, h = im.size
    for row in range(h):
        for col in range(w):
            r, g, b = im.getpixel((col, row))
            r = r // 36 * 36
            g = g // 42 * 42
            b = b // 42 * 42
            im.putpixel((col, row), (r, g, b))
    im.show()

simple_quant("bubbles.jpg")</pre>
    <p>Figure&#xA0;<url href="#fig_simplecompare" visual="#fig_simplecompare">[fig_simplecompare]</url> shows a before and
                after comparison of original and quantized images. Of course, these
                are color pictures that have been converted to gray scale for
                publication.
                You can use any JPEG color image from your collection and run the program to see the real difference in full color.
                Notice how much
                detail is lost in the quantized picture. The grass has lost nearly all
                its detail and is uniformly green, and the skin tones have been reduced
                to two shades of tan.</p>

    <title>An Improved Quantization Algorithm Using Octrees</title>
    <p>The problem with the simple method of quantization just described is
                that the colors in most pictures are not evenly distributed throughout
                the color cube. Many colors may not appear in the image, so parts of
                the cube may go completely unused. Allocating an unused color to the
                quantized image is a waste. Figure&#xA0;<url href="#fig_colordist" visual="#fig_colordist">3</url> shows the
                distribution of the colors that are used in the example image. Notice
                how little of the color cube space is actually used.</p>

    <p>To make a better quantized image we need to find a way to do a better
                job of selecting the set of colors we want to use to represent our
                image. There are several algorithms for dividing the color cube in
                different ways to allow for the better use of colors. In this section we
                are going to look at a tree-based solution. The tree solution we will
                use makes use of an <term>octree</term>. An octree is similar to a binary
                tree; however, each node in an octree has eight children. Here is the
                interface we will implement for our octree abstract data type:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><c>Octree()</c> creates a new empty octree.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><c>insert(r, g, b)</c> adds a new node to the octree using the red,
                        green, and blue color values as the key.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><c>find(r, g, b)</c> finds an existing node, or the closest
                        approximation, using the red, green, and blue color values as the
                        search key.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><c>reduce(n)</c> reduces the size of the octree so that there are
                        <math>n</math> or fewer leaf nodes.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Here is how an octree is used to divide the color cube:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The root of the octree represents the entire cube.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The second level of the octree represents a single slice through
                        each dimension (<math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, and <math>z</math>) that evenly divides the cube into eight
                        pieces.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The next level of the tree divides each of the eight sub-cubes into eight
                        additional cubes for a total of 64 cubes. Notice that the cube
                        represented by the parent node totally contains all of the sub-cubes
                        represented by the children. As we follow any path down the tree we
                        are staying within the boundary of the parent, but getting
                        progressively more specific about the portion of the cube.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The eighth level of the tree represents the full resolution of 16.7
                        million colors in our color cube.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Now that you know how we can represent the color cube using an
                octree, you may be thinking that the octree is just another
                way to divide up the color cube into even parts. You are correct.
                However, because the octree is hierarchical, we can take advantage
                of the hierarchy to use larger cubes to represent unused portions of the
                color cube and smaller cubes to represent the popular colors. Here is an
                overview of how we will use an octree to do a better job of
                selecting a subset of the colors in an image:</p>
    <p>
      <ol label="1">
        <li>
          <p>For each pixel in the image:</p>
          <p>
            <ol label="1">
              <li>
                <p>Search for the color of this pixel in the octree. The color
                                will be a leaf node at the eighth level.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>If the color is not found create a new leaf node at the eighth
                                level (and possibly some internal nodes above the leaf).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>If the color is already present in the tree increment the counter
                                in the leaf node to keep track of how many pixels are this color.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Repeat until the number of leaf nodes is less than or equal to the
                        target number of colors.</p>
          <p>
            <ol label="1">
              <li>
                <p>Find the deepest leaf node with the smallest number of uses.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Merge the leaf node and all of its siblings together to form a new
                                leaf node.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The remaining leaf nodes form the color set for this image.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To map an original color to its quantized value simply search down
                        the tree until you get to a leaf node. Return the color values stored
                        in the leaf.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>The ideas outlined above are encoded as a Python function to read,
                quantize, and display an image in the function <c>build_and_display()</c>

            r, g, b = img.getpixel((col, row))
            ot.insert(r, g, b)
    ot.reduce(256)

    <p>The <c>build_and_display</c> function follows the basic process just described.

                read each pixel and add it to the octree.
                Second, the
                number of leaf nodes is reduced by the <c>reduce</c> method on line
                <url href="#lst_bad:line_callotreduce" visual="#lst_bad:line_callotreduce">[lst_bad:line_callotreduce]</url>.
                Finally, the image is updated by searching for a color, using <c>find</c>,
                in the reduced octree on line
                <url href="#lst_bad:line_otfind" visual="#lst_bad:line_otfind">[lst_bad:line_otfind]</url>.</p>
    <p>We are using the Python image library to
                open an existing image file (<c>Image.open</c>), read a pixel
                (<c>getpixel</c>), write a pixel (<c>putpixel</c>), and display the
                result to the screen (<c>show</c>). <c>build_and_display</c> interacts with the octree

    <p>First notice that the constructor for an <c>Octree</c> initializes the
                root node to <c>None</c>. Then it sets up three important attributes that
                all the nodes of an octree may need to access. Those attributes
                are <c>max_level</c>, <c>num_leaves</c>, and <c>all_leaves</c>. The
                <c>max_level</c> attribute limits the total depth of the tree. Notice that
                in our implementation we have initialized <c>max_level</c> to five. This is
                a small optimization that simply allows us to ignore the two least
                significant bits of color information. It keeps the overall size of the
                tree much smaller and doesn't hurt the quality of the final image at
                all. The <c>num_leaves</c> and <c>all_leaves</c> attributes allow us to keep
                track of the number of leaf nodes and allow us direct access to the
                leaves without traversing all the way down the tree. We will see why
                this is important shortly.</p>
    <p>The <c>insert</c> and <c>find</c> methods behave exactly like their cousins in
                chapter <url href="#chap_tree" visual="#chap_tree">[chap_tree]</url>. They each check to see if a root
                node exists, and then call the corresponding method in the root node.
                Notice that <c>insert</c> and <c>find</c> both use the red, green, and blue
                components (<c>(r, g, b)</c>) to identify a node in the tree.</p>
    <p>The <c>reduce</c> method is defined on line
                <url href="#lst_octreedef:line_otreduce" visual="#lst_octreedef:line_otreduce">[lst_octreedef:line_otreduce]</url> of
                Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst:octreedef" visual="#lst:octreedef">[lst:octreedef]</url>. This method simply loops
                until the number of leaves in the leaf list is less than the total
                number of colors we want to have in the final image (defined by the
                parameter <c>max_cubes</c>). <c>reduce</c> makes use of a helper function
                <c>find_min_cube</c> to find the node in the octree with the smallest
                reference count. Once the node with the smallest reference count is
                found, that node is merged into a single node with all of its siblings
                (see line
                <url href="#lst_octreedef:line_otredmerge" visual="#lst_octreedef:line_otredmerge">[lst_octreedef:line_otredmerge]</url>).</p>
    <p>The <c>find_min_cube</c> method is implemented using the <c>all_leaves</c> and
                a simple find minimum loop pattern. When the number of leaf nodes is
                large, and it could be as large is 16.7 million, this approach is not
                very efficient. In one of the exercises you are asked to modify the
                <c>Octree</c> class and improve the efficiency of <c>find_min_cube</c>.</p>
    <p>One of the things to mention about the <c>Octree</c> class is that it uses an instance
                of the class <c>OTNode</c> which is defined inside the the <c>Octree</c> class. A class
                that is defined inside another class is called an <em>inner class</em>.
                We define <c>OTNode</c> inside <c>Octree</c> because each node
                of an octree needs to have access to some information that is
                stored in an instance of the <c>Octree</c> class. Another reason for making
                <c>OTNode</c> an inner class is that there is no reason for any code
                outside of the <c>Octree</c> class to use it. The way that an octree
                is implemented is really a private detail that nobody
                else needs to know about. This is a good software engineering practice
                known as <em>information hiding</em>.</p>
    <p>Now let's look at the class definition for the nodes in an octree
                (Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst_otnodedef" visual="#lst_otnodedef">[lst_otnodedef]</url>).
                The constructor for the <c>OTNode</c> class has three optional parameters: <c>parent</c>,
                <c>level</c>, and <c>outer</c>.
                These parameters allow the <c>Octree</c> methods to construct new
                nodes under a variety of circumstances. As we did with binary search
                trees, we will keep track of the parent of a node explicitly. The level
                of the node simply indicates its depth in the tree. The most interesting
                of these three parameters is the <c>outer</c> parameter, which is a
                reference to the instance of the <c>octree</c> class that created this
                node. <c>outer</c> will function like <c>self</c> in that it will allow the
                instances of <c>OTNode</c> to access attributes of an instance of
                <c>Octree</c>.</p>
    <p>The other attributes that we want to remember about each node in an
                <c>octree</c> include the reference <c>count</c> and the red, green, and blue
                components of the color represented by this tree. As you will note in
                the <c>insert</c> function, only a leaf node of the tree will have values
                for <c>red</c>, <c>green</c>, <c>blue</c>, and <c>count</c>. Also note that since
                each node can have up to eight children we initialize a list of eight
                references to keep track of them all. Rather than a left and right child
                as in binary trees, an octree has 0&#x2013;7 children.</p>
    <pre>class OTNode:
    def __init__(self, parent=None, level=0, outer=None):
        self.red = 0
        self.green = 0
        self.blue = 0
        self.count = 0
        self.parent = parent
        self.level = level
        self.oTree = outer
        self.children = [None] * 8</pre>
    <p>Now we get into the really interesting parts of the octree
                implementation. The Python code for inserting a new node into an
                octree is shown in Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst_otninsert" visual="#lst_otninsert">[lst_otninsert]</url>.
                The first problem we need to solve is how to figure out where to place a
                new node in the tree. In a binary search tree we used the rule that a
                new node with a key less than its parent went in the left subtree, and a
                new node with a key greater than its parent went in the right subtree.
                But with eight possible children for each node it is not that simple. In
                addition, when indexing colors it is not obvious what the key for each
                node should be. In an <c>octree</c> we will use the information from the
                three color components. Figure&#xA0;<url href="#fig_otindex" visual="#fig_otindex">4</url> shows how we can use
                the red, green, and blue color values to compute an index for the
                position of the new node at each level of the tree. The corresponding
                Python code for computing the index is on
                line&#xA0;<url href="#lst_otninsert:line_otci" visual="#lst_otninsert:line_otci">[lst_otninsert:line_otci]</url> of
                Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst_otninsert" visual="#lst_otninsert">[lst_otninsert]</url>.</p>
    <pre>def insert(self, r, g, b, level, outer):
    if level &lt; self.oTree.max_level:
        idx = self.compute_index(
            r, g, b, level
        )
        if self.children[idx] == None:
            self.children[idx] = outer.OTNode(
                parent=self,
                level=level + 1,
                outer=outer,
            )
        self.children[idx].insert(
            r, g, b, level + 1, outer
        )
    else:
        if self.count == 0:
            self.oTree.num_leaves = (
                self.oTree.num_leaves + 1
            )
            self.oTree.all_leaves.append(self)
        self.red += r
        self.green += g
        self.blue += b
        self.count = self.count + 1

def compute_index(self, r, g, b, l):  |\label{lst_otninsert:line_otci}|
    shift = 8 - l
    rc = r &gt;&gt; shift - 2 &amp; 0x4
    gc = g &gt;&gt; shift - 1 &amp; 0x2
    bc = b &gt;&gt; shift &amp; 0x1
    return rc | gc | bc</pre>
    <p>The computation of the index combines bits from each of the red, green,
                and blue color components, starting at the top of the tree with the
                highest order bits. Figure&#xA0;<url href="#fig_otindex" visual="#fig_otindex">4</url> shows the binary
                representation of the red, green, and blue components of 163, 98, 231.
                At the root of the tree we start with the most significant bit from each
                of the three color components; in this case the three bits are 1, 0, and
                1. Putting these bits together we get binary 101 or decimal 5. You can
                see the binary manipulation of the red, green, and blue numbers in the
                <c>compute_index</c> method on
                line&#xA0;<url href="#lst_otninsert:line_otci" visual="#lst_otninsert:line_otci">[lst_otninsert:line_otci]</url> in
                Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst_otninsert" visual="#lst_otninsert">[lst_otninsert]</url>.</p>
    <p>The operators used in the <c>compute_index</c> may be unfamiliar to you.
                The <c>&gt;&gt;</c> operator is the right shift operation. The <c>&amp;</c> is bitwise
                <c>and</c>, and <c>|</c> is logical <c>or</c>. The bitwise <c>or</c> and bitwise
                <c>and</c> operations work just like the logical operations used in
                conditionals, except that they work on the individual bits of a number.
                The shift operation simply moves the bits <math>n</math> places to the right,
                filling in with zeros on the left and dropping the bits as they go off
                the right.</p>
    <p>Once we have computed the index appropriate for the current level of the tree,
                we traverse down into the subtree. In the example in
                Figure&#xA0;<url href="#fig_otindex" visual="#fig_otindex">4</url> we follow the link at position&#xA0;5 in the
                <c>children</c> array. If there is no node at position&#xA0;5, we create one. We
                keep traversing down the tree until we get to <c>max_level</c>. At
                <c>max_level</c> we stop searching and store the data. Notice that we do
                not overwrite the data in the leaf node, but rather we add the color
                components to any existing components and increment the reference
                counter. This allows us to compute the average of any color below the
                current node in the color cube. In this way, a leaf node in the
                <c>octree</c> may represent a number of similar colors in the color cube.</p>

                uses the same method of index computation as the <c>insert</c> method to

                components.</p>

    if level &lt; self.oTree.max_level:

            return self.children[idx].find(

    <p>The <c>find</c> method has three exit conditions:</p>
    <p>
      <ol label="1">
        <li>
          <p>We have reached the maximum level of the tree and so we return the
                        average of the color information stored in this leaf node (see lines&#xA0;17&#x2013;21).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>We have found a leaf node at a height less than <c>max_level</c> (see lines&#xA0;9&#x2013;13).

        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>The final aspect of the <c>OTNode</c> class is the <c>merge</c> method. It
                allows a parent to subsume all of its children and become a leaf node
                itself. If you remember back to the structure of the <c>octree</c> where
                each parent cube fully encloses all the cubes represented by the
                children, you will see why this makes sense. When we merge a group of
                siblings we are effectively taking a weighted average of the colors
                represented by each of those siblings. Since all the siblings are
                relatively close to each other in color space, the average is a good
                representation of all of them. Figure&#xA0;<url href="#fig_otmerge" visual="#fig_otmerge">5</url> illustrates
                the merge process for some sibling nodes.</p>

    <p>Figure&#xA0;<url href="#fig_otmerge" visual="#fig_otmerge">5</url> shows the red, green, and blue components
                represented by the four leaf nodes whose identifying color values are
                (101, 122, 167), (100, 122, 183), (123, 108, 163), and (126, 113, 166).
                As you can see in Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst_otnfind" visual="#lst_otnfind">[lst_otnfind]</url>
                the identifying values are calculated dividing the color values by the count.
                Notice how close they are in the overall color space. The leaf node that gets
                created from all of these has an ID of (112, 115, 168). This is close to
                the average of the four, but weighted more towards the third color tuple
                due to the fact that it had a reference count of 12.</p>

    <p>Because the <c>octree</c> uses only colors that are really present in the
                image and faithfully preserves colors that are often used, the final
                quantized image from the <c>octree</c> is much higher quality than the
                simple method we used to start this section.
                Figure&#xA0;<url href="#fig_otquantcompare" visual="#fig_otquantcompare">[fig_otquantcompare]</url> shows a comparison
                of the original image with the quantized image.</p>
    <p>There are many additional ways to compress images using techniques such
                as run-length encoding, discrete cosine transform, and Huffman coding.
                Any of these algorithms are within your grasp and we encourage you to
                look them up and read about them. In addition, quantized images can be
                improved by using a technique known as <term>dithering</term>. Dithering is a
                process by which different colors are placed near each other so that
                the eye blends the colors together, forming a more realistic image. This
                is an old trick used by newspapers for doing color printing using just
                black plus three different colors of ink. Again you can research
                dithering and try to apply it to some images on your own.</p>
