      <li>
        <p>Where do skip lists get their name?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Compare the notion of a perfectly balanced binary search tree and a
                    skip list. Can you draw pictures to describe these notions?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What would it mean if all towers in a skip list were one level high?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Given a set of 20 keys, is it possible that one of the towers could
                    have a height of 20?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Run the octree quantization program on an image of your choice.
                    Try some different settings for the maximum depth of the tree as well
                    as the final number of colors.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Explain why the indices for an octree node are calculated
                    starting with the most significant bit and going to the least
                    significant bit.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Draw the nodes in an octree, down to level 5, after inserting
                    the following two colors: (174, 145, 229) and (92, 145, 85).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Draw a DFA graph for the pattern ATC.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Compute the mismatched links for the pattern ATC.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Create a KMP graph for the pattern ATCCAT.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Implement the following methods for the <c>ArrayList</c> class and then
                    analyze their performance.</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><c>__delitem__</c>: Delete the item at the given index from the list.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><c>pop</c>: Implement the pop method with and without a positional
                            parameter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><c>index</c>: Search for a given value in the <c>ArrayList</c>. Return
                            its position in the list if it is found and -1 if the item is not
                            present.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><c>__iter__</c>: Make the <c>ArrayList</c> iterable.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Modify <c>encrypt</c> method of the Caesar cipher (Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst_enc" visual="#lst_enc">[lst_enc]</url>)
                    to accept a parameter that specifies the encryption key.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Python list supports both concatenation and repetition. Add
                    support for the <c>+</c> and <c>*</c> operators to the <c>ArrayList</c>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Implement the <c>delete</c> method for a skip list. You can assume that
                    the key is present.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Implement methods for a skip list that will allow the map to perform
                    the following operations:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><c>__contains__()</c> will return a boolean result as to whether a
                            key is present in the map.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><c>keys()</c> will return a list of keys in the map.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><c>values()</c> will return a list of values in the map.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Implement the <c>__getitem__()</c> and the <c>__setitem__()</c> methods for a skip
                    list.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Modify the <c>Octree</c> class to improve the performance of the
                    <c>reduce</c> method by using a more efficient data structure for
                    keeping track of the leaf nodes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add two methods to the <c>Octree</c> class, one to write a quantized
                    image to a disk file and one to read a file of the same format you
                    wrote.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Some versions of <c>Octree</c> quantization look at the total count for
                    all the children of a node and use that information to decide which
                    nodes to reduce. Modify the <c>Octree</c> implementation to use this
                    method of node selection for reducing the tree.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Implement a version of the simple pattern-matcher that will locate
                    all occurrences of the pattern in the text.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Modify the graph implementation from Chapter&#xA0;<url href="#graphs" visual="#graphs">[graphs]</url>
                    so that it can be used to represent KMP graphs. Using the
                    <c>mismatched_links</c> method, write a method that will take a pattern
                    and create the complete KMP graph. With the graph complete, write a
                    program that will run an arbitrary text against the KMP graph and
                    return whether a match exists.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
