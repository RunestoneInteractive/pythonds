  <title>Recursion Revisited</title>
  <p>One of the most common uses of numerical computing today is in the field
            of cryptography. Each time you check your bank account, sign on to a
            secure website to purchase something, or sign on to your computer, you
            are using cryptography. In a general sense, <em>cryptography</em> is
            concerned with encrypting and decrypting information that you do not
            want other people to see. In this section we will look at some functions
            that are used in everyday cryptographic programming. In practice there
            may be faster ways to implement these functions, but each of them has an
            interesting recursive implementation.</p>
  <p>The algorithms in this section make use of Python's modulo operator (%).
            Remember that <m>a \% b</m> is what is left over after <m>a</m> is
            divided by <m>b</m>, for example <m>10 \% 7 = 3</m>. When we compute
            the result of any mathematical expression modulo 10, the only possible
            results are 0&#x2013;9.</p>
  <p>One of the earliest forms of cryptography used only simple modular
            arithmetic. Take the string <c>"uryybjbeyq"</c>, for example. Can you guess
            what message is encrypted? Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst_enc" visual="#lst_enc">[lst_enc]</url> shows you
            the function that produced the message. Look at the listing and see if
            you can figure it out.</p>
  <pre>def encrypt(m):
    s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    n = ""
    for i in m:
        j = (s.find(i) + 13) % 26
        n = n + s[j]
    return n</pre>
  <p>The <c>encrypt</c> function illustrates a form of encryption known as the
            Caesar Cipher. It also goes by the name ROT13, which is a bit more
            descriptive. <c>encrypt</c> simply takes each letter in the message and
            adds 13 to its ordinal position in the alphabet. If the position goes
            past the end of the alphabet, it wraps around. This wraparound function
            is easily accomplished using the modulo operator. In addition, since
            there are 26 letters in the alphabet, this function is symmetric. The
            symmetry allows us to use the function to encrypt and decrypt the same
            message. If you pass the string <c>"uryybjbeyg"</c> to the <c>encrypt</c>
            function, it returns <c>"helloworld"</c>.</p>
  <p>Rotations by amounts other than 13 are possible; however, they are not
            symmetric with respect to encrypting and decrypting. Asymmetry would
            require us to write a separate decryption algorithm that subtracts the
            amount to rotate. In that case, we could generalize both the <c>encrypt</c>
            and <c>decrypt</c> functions to take the amount of rotation as a parameter.
            In cryptographic terms, the rotation parameter is called the <em>key</em> and
            would be the number of positions to rotate. Given the message and the
            key, the encryption and decryption algorithms can do their jobs.
            Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst_dec_key" visual="#lst_dec_key">[lst_dec_key]</url> shows the decryption algorithm
            that takes the amount of rotation as a parameter. As an exercise you
            should be able to modify Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst_enc" visual="#lst_enc">[lst_enc]</url> to accept a
            parameter that specifies a key.</p>
  <pre>def decrypt(m, k):
    s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    n = ""
    for i in m:
        j = (s.find(i) + 26 - k) % 26
        n = n + s[j]
    return n</pre>
  <p>Even if you keep the number <c>k</c> from everyone except the person you
            are sending the message to, this simple form of encryption is not going
            to stop anyone from stealing your secrets for very long. In the
            remainder of this section, we will build up to a much more secure form
            of encryption, the RSA <term>public key encryption</term> algorithm.</p>

    <title>Modular Arithmetic Theorems</title>
    <p>If two numbers, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, give the same remainder when
                divided by <m>n</m>, we say that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are <q>congruent

  <subsection xml:id="advanced_modular-exponentiation">
    <title>Modular Exponentiation</title>
    <p>Suppose we wanted to know the last digit of <m>3^{1,254,906}</m>. Not
                only is that a large computation problem, but using Python's
                arbitrary-precision integers the number has 598,743 digits! All we want to know
                is the value of the rightmost digit. There are really two problems here.
                First, how do we compute <m>x^n</m> efficiently? Second, how can we
                compute <m>x^n \pmod{p}</m> without first calculating all 598,743
                digits and then looking at the last one?</p>
    <p>The answer to the second question is easy, given the third theorem from
                above.</p>
    <p>
      <ol marker="1">
        <li>
          <p>Initialize result to 1.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Repeat <m>n</m> times:</p>
          <p>
            <ol marker="1">
              <li>
                <p>Multiply result by <m>x</m>.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Apply modulo operation to result.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>The above approach makes the computation simpler because we are keeping
                the result smaller rather than following it out to its full precision.
                However, we can do even better using a recursive approach.</p>
    <math_block docname="Advanced/RecursionRevisited"  nowrap="False" number="True" xml:space="preserve">x^n =
   \begin{cases}
   (x \cdot x)^{ n/2 } &amp; \text{if :math:`n` is even} \\
   (x \cdot x^{n-1}) = x \cdot (x \cdot x)^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} &amp; \text{if :math:`n` is odd}
   \end{cases}
   \label{eqn:pow}</math_block>
    <p>Remember that for a floating point number <m>n</m> the floor operation,
                <m>\lfloor n \rfloor</m>, results in the largest integer smaller than
                <m>n</m>. Python's integer division operator returns the floor of the
                result of the division, so we do not need to do anything special in our
                code to achieve the results we want. The above equation gives us a very
                nice recursive definition for computing <m>x^n</m>. All we need now is
                a base case. Recall that for any number <m>x</m>, <m>x^0 = 1</m>.
                Since we are reducing the size of our exponent in each recursive call,
                checking for the condition <m>n = 0</m> is a good base case.</p>
    <pre>def modexp(x, n, p):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    t = (x * x) % p
    tmp = modexp(t, n // 2, p)
    if n % 2 != 0:
        tmp = (tmp * x) % p
    return tmp</pre>
    <p>Notice that in the above equation both the even and odd cases include a
                factor of <m>(x \cdot x)^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}</m>, so we compute that
                unconditionally and store it in the variable <c>tmp</c>. Also note that
                since we are computing modulo <c>p</c> we still apply the modulo operator
                at each step of the calculation. The solution in
                Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst_pow" visual="#lst_pow">[lst_pow]</url> keeps the result size small and uses
                many fewer multiplications than a purely iterative approach.</p>

  <subsection xml:id="advanced_the-greatest-common-divisor-and-multiplicative-inverses">
    <title>The Greatest Common Divisor and Multiplicative Inverses</title>
    <p>A <em>multiplicative inverse</em> of a positive integer <m>x</m> modulo
                <m>m</m> is any number <m>a</m> such that
                <m>ax \equiv 1 \pmod{m}</m>. For example, let <m>x = 3</m>,
                <m>m = 7</m>, and <m>a = 5</m>; <m>3 \times 5 = 15</m> and
                <m>15\ \%\ 7 = 1</m>, so 5 is a multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 7.</p>
    <p>The idea of multiplicative inverses in the world of modulo arithmetic
                may seem very confusing at first. How did we select 5 in the previous
                example? Is 5 the only multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 7? Do all
                numbers <m>a</m> have a multiplicative inverse for any given <m>m</m>?</p>
    <p>Let's look at an example that may shed some light on the first question:
                how did we select 5 as the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 7? Look
                at the following Python session:</p>
    <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(1, 40):
...    if (3 * i) % 7 == 1:
...        print i
...
5
12
19
26
33</pre>
    <p>This little experiment tells us that there are many multiplicative
                inverses (modulo 7) for <m>x=3</m> and <m>m = 7</m>, namely
                <m>5, 12, 19, 26, 33</m>, and so on. Do you notice anything interesting
                about the sequence? Each number in the sequence is two less than a
                multiple of seven.</p>
    <p>Do all pairs of numbers <m>x</m> and <m>m</m> have a multiplicative
                inverse? Let's look at another example. Consider <m>x=4</m> and
                <m>m=8</m>. Plugging 4 and 8 into the loop in the previous example
                gives us no output. If we take out the conditional and print out the
                results of <m>(4 \cdot i)\ \%\ 8</m>, we get the sequence <m>(0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4\dots</m>).
                Here we have a case where the remainder alternates between 0 and 4
                repeatedly. Clearly the result is never going to be 1. How can we know
                that ahead of time?</p>
    <p>The answer is that a number <m>x</m> has a multiplicative inverse,
                modulo <m>m</m>, if and only if <m>m</m> and <m>x</m> are relatively
                prime. Two numbers are relatively prime if <m>gcd(m,x) = 1</m>. Recall
                that the greatest common divisor (GCD) is the largest integer that
                divides both numbers. The next question is how can we compute the
                greatest common divisor for a pair of numbers?</p>
    <p>Given two numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> we can find the GCD by
                repeatedly subtracting <m>b</m> from <m>a</m> until <m>a &lt; b</m>.
                When <m>a &lt; b</m>, we switch roles for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. At some
                point <m>a - b</m> becomes 0, so we swap <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> one
                more time. At that point we have <m>gcd(a, 0) = a</m>. This algorithm
                was first described more than 2,000 years ago and is called Euclid's
                algorithm.</p>
    <p>In terms of recursive algorithm design, Euclid's algorithm is very
                straightforward. The base case is when <m>b = 0</m>. There are two
                possibilities for a recursive call: when <m>a &lt; b</m>, we swap
                <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and make a recursive call. Otherwise, we can
                make a recursive call passing <m>a - b</m> in place of <m>a</m>.
                Euclid's algorithm is shown in Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst_gcd1" visual="#lst_gcd1">[lst_gcd1]</url>.</p>
    <pre>def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    elif a &lt; b:
        return gcd(b, a)
    return gcd(a - b, b)</pre>
    <p>Although Euclid's algorithm is quite easy to understand and program, it
                is not as efficient as we would like, particularly if <m>a &gt;&gt; b</m>.
                Once again, modular arithmetic comes to our rescue. Notice that the
                result of the last subtraction (when <m>a - b &lt; b</m>) is really the
                same as the remainder of <m>a</m> divided by <m>b</m>. With that in
                mind, we can cut out all of the subtractions and combine the swap of
                <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in one recursive call. A revised algorithm is
                shown in Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst_gcd2" visual="#lst_gcd2">[lst_gcd2]</url>.</p>
    <pre>def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return gcd(b, a % b)</pre>
    <p>Now that we have a way to know whether two numbers <m>x</m> and
                <m>m</m> will have a multiplicative inverse, our next task is to write
                an efficient algorithm to compute the inverse. Suppose that for any pair
                of numbers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> we could compute both
                <m>gcd(x,y)</m> and a pair of integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> such
                that <m>d = gcd(x, y) = ax + by</m>. For example,
                <m>1 = gcd(3, 7) = -2 \times 3 + 1 \times 7</m>, so here <m>a = -2</m>
                and <m>b = 1</m> are possible values for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
                Rather than any numbers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, let's use <m>m</m> and
                <m>x</m> from our previous examples. Now we have
                <m>1 = gcd(m, x) = am + bx</m>. From the discussion at the beginning of
                this section we know that <m>bx = 1 \mod{m}</m>, so <m>b</m> is a
                multiplicative inverse of <m>x</m> modulo <m>m</m>.</p>
    <p>We have reduced the problem of computing inverses to the problem of
                finding integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> that satisfy the equation
                <m>d = gcd(x, y) = ax + by</m>. Since we started this problem with the
                GCD algorithm, we can finish it with an extension of this algorithm
                as well. We will take two numbers <m>x &gt;= y</m> and return a tuple
                <m>(d, a, b)</m> such that <m>d = gcd(x, y)</m> and
                <m>d = ax + by</m>. The extension to Euclid's algorithm is shown in
                Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst_gcd3" visual="#lst_gcd3">[lst_gcd3]</url>.</p>
    <pre>def ext_gcd(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return (x, 1, 0)
    else:
        (d, a, b) = ext_gcd(y, x % y)
        return (d, b, a - (x // y) * b)  |\label{line:gcd3_return}|</pre>
    <p>Notice that when we get the base case <m>y = 0</m>, we return
                <m>d = x</m> just like the original Euclid's algorithm. However, we
                return two additional values <m>a =1</m> and <m>b = 0</m>. Together
                these three values satisfy the equation <m>d = ax + by</m>. If
                <m>y &gt; 0</m>, then we recursively compute values <m>(d, a, b)</m> such
                that <m>d = gcd(y, x \mod{y})</m> and <m>d = ay + b(x \mod{y})</m>.
                As with the original algorithm, <m>d = gcd(x, y)</m>. But what about
                the other two values, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>? We know that <m>a</m>
                and <m>b</m> must be integers, so let's call them <m>A</m> and
                <m>B</m>. Further, we know that <m>d = Ax + By</m>. To figure out what
                <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> should be, let's rearrange the equation as
                follows:</p>
    <math_block docname="Advanced/RecursionRevisited"  nowrap="False" number="True" xml:space="preserve">\begin{aligned}
d = &amp; ay + b(x \mod{y}) \\
  = &amp; ay + b(x - \lfloor x / y \rfloor y) \\
  = &amp; bx + (a - \lfloor x / y \rfloor b)y\end{aligned}</math_block>
    <p>Note the substitution made in the second line,
                <m>x \mod{y} = x - \lfloor x / y \rfloor</m>. This is legal because
                this is how we would normally calculate the remainder of x / y
                (<m>x \mod{y}</m>). Looking at the rearranged equation, we can see that
                <m>A = b</m> and <m>B = a - \lfloor x / y \rfloor b</m>. Notice that
                this is exactly what line <url href="#line:gcd3_return" visual="#line:gcd3_return">[line:gcd3_return]</url>
                does! To check this, note that at each return step in the algorithm the
                return values satisfy the equation <m>d = ax + by</m>.
                To understand how our extended GCD algorithm works, let's start with an
                example: let <m>x = 25</m> and <m>y = 9</m>. Figure&#xA0;<url href="#fig_gcd" visual="#fig_gcd">1</url>
                illustrates the call and return values for the recursive function.</p>

    <title>RSA Algorithm</title>
    <p>Now we have all the tools we need to write the RSA encryption algorithm.
                The <term>RSA algorithm</term> is perhaps the easiest to understand of all the
                public key encryption algorithms. Public key cryptography was invented
                by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman and independently by Ralph
                Merkle. The major contribution of public key cryptography was the idea
                that keys could come in pairs: an encryption key to convert the
                plaintext message to ciphertext, and a decryption key to convert the
                ciphertext back to plaintext. The keys only work one way so that a
                message encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with the
                public key, and vice versa.</p>
    <p>RSA gets its security from the difficulty of factoring large numbers.
                The public and private keys are derived from a pair of large (100&#x2013;200
                digit) prime numbers. Since long integers are native to Python, this is
                a fun and easy algorithm to implement.</p>
    <p>To generate the two keys, choose two large prime numbers <m>p</m> and
                <m>q</m>. Then compute the product</p>
    <math_block docname="Advanced/RecursionRevisited"  nowrap="False" number="True" xml:space="preserve">n = p \times q

</math_block>
    <p>The next step is to randomly choose the encryption key <m>e</m> such
                that <m>e</m> and <m>(p - 1) \times (q - 1)</m> are relatively prime;
                that is</p>
    <math_block docname="Advanced/RecursionRevisited"  nowrap="False" number="True" xml:space="preserve">gcd(e, (p - 1) \times (q-1)) = 1

</math_block>
    <p>Finally, the decryption key <m>d</m> is simply the multiplicative
                inverse of <m>e</m> modulo <m>(p - 1) \times (q - 1)</m>. For this we
                can use our extended version of Euclid's algorithm.</p>
    <p>The numbers <m>e</m> and <m>n</m> taken together are the public key.
                The number <m>d</m> is the private key. Once we have computed
                <m>n, e</m>, and <m>d</m>, the original primes <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>
                are no longer needed. However, they should not be revealed.</p>
    <p>To encrypt a message we simply use the equation
                <m>c = m^e \pmod{n}</m>. To decrypt the message we use
                <m>m = c^d \pmod{n}</m>.</p>
    <p>It is easy to see that this works when you remember that <m>d</m> is
                the multiplicative inverse of <m>e \pmod{n}</m>.</p>
    <math_block docname="Advanced/RecursionRevisited"  nowrap="False" number="True" xml:space="preserve">\begin{aligned}
   c^d &amp; = (m^e)^d  \pmod{n} \\
       &amp; = m^{ed}   \pmod{n} \\
       &amp; = m^1  \pmod{n} \\
       &amp; = m \pmod{n} \end{aligned}</math_block>
    <p>Before we turn all these equations into Python code, we need to talk
                about a couple of other details. First, how do we take a text message
                like <q>hello world</q> and turn it into a number? The easiest way is to
                simply use the ASCII values associated with each character and
                concatenate all the numbers together. However, since the decimal
                versions of the numbers of the ASCII values vary in the number of digits
                needed to represent them, we will use the hexadecimal numbers where we
                know very reliably that two hexadecimal digits represent a single byte
                or character.</p>

    <p>Putting all the hexadecimal digits together we could convert that large
                hex number into a decimal integer:</p>
    <math_block docname="Advanced/RecursionRevisited"  nowrap="False" number="True" xml:space="preserve">m =
126207244316550804821666916</math_block>
    <p>Python can handle this large number just fine. However, there are two
                reasons that real programs using RSA encryption break the message up
                into smaller chunks and encrypt each chunk. The first reason is
                performance. Even a relatively short email message, say 1k of text, will
                generate a number with 2,000 to 3,000 digits! If we raise that to a
                power of <m>d</m> which has 10 digits, we are talking about a very long number
                indeed.</p>
    <p>The second reason for breaking the message into chunks is the
                restriction that <m>m \le n</m>. We must be sure that the message has a
                unique representation modulo <m>n</m>. With binary data, choose the
                largest power of two that is less than <m>n</m>. For example, let's choose
                <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> to be 5563 and 8191. So
                <m>n = 5563 \times 8191 = 45,566,533</m>. To keep the integer value of
                our chunks less than <m>m</m>, we will divide up our word into chunks
                that use less than the number of bytes needed to represent <m>n</m>.
                This is easy to find in Python using the integer method <c>bit_length</c>.
                Given the number of bits needed to represent a number, we can divide by eight
                to find the number of bytes. Since each character in the message can be
                represented by a single byte, this division tells us the number of bytes
                we can put in each chunk. Conveniently, this lets us simply break the
                message up into chunks of <m>n</m> characters and convert the hexadecimal
                representation of each chunk into an integer. For this example we can
                represent <m>45,566,533</m> using 26 bits. Using integer division and
                dividing by eight tells us that we should break our message into chunks
                of three characters.</p>
    <p>The characters <q>h,</q> <q>e,</q> and <q>l</q> have the hexadecimal values of <m>68</m>,
                <m>65</m>, and <m>6c</m>, respectively. Concatenating those together gives us <m>68656c</m> and
                converting that to a decimal gives us <m>6841708</m>.</p>

    <p>Note that breaking the message into chunks can be very tricky, in particular
                when the result of applying the RSA transformation to a chunk produces a
                number that is less than seven digits long. In this case we need to be
                careful to add a leading zero to the result when we glue our
                chunks back together again. You can see how this might happen in
                <m>m_1</m> and <m>m_4</m> above.</p>
    <p>Now let's choose a value for <m>e</m>. We can select values randomly
                and use the GCD algorithm to test them against
                <m>(p - 1) \times (q - 1) = 45552780</m>. Remember that we are looking
                for an <m>e</m> that is relatively prime to 45,552,780. The number
                1,471 will work nicely for this example.</p>

    <p>The last thing to look at is the two helper functions that break our
                string into chunks and merge chunks into a string (Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst_chunk" visual="#lst_chunk">[lst_chunk]</url>).
                These functions make use of Python <c>bytearray</c> objects, which allow us to store
                any string as a sequence of bytes.  This makes it very convenient for
                us to convert a string to a sequence of hexadecimal digits and allows
                us to convert a sequence of hexadecimal digits back to a string.</p>

    <p>In Listing&#xA0;<url href="#lst_chunk" visual="#lst_chunk">[lst_chunk]</url> we see the procedure for turning
                a string into a list of chunks. One important thing to note is that we
                must always make sure that our hexadecimal number corresponds to a
                character that is exactly two digits long. This means that sometimes we
                may need to add a leading zero. We can do this easily by using the
                string formatting expression <c>f"{b:02x}"</c>. This expression creates a
                string that is exactly two characters long, with a leading zero
                at the beginning if necessary. Once we have created a single long
                hexadecimal string out of the entire message, we can then break up that
                long string into <c>num_chunks</c> chunks of hexadecimal numbers. This is
                what is happening in the <c>for</c> loop (starting on line&#xA0;6). Finally, we can transform each
                hexadecimal number into an integer using the <c>eval</c> function and the
                list comprehension.</p>
    <p>Transforming the decrypted chunks back to a string is as easy as
                creating a single long hex string and turning that hexadecimal string
                into a <c>bytearray</c>. The <c>bytearray</c> has a built-in <c>decode</c>
                function to turn the <c>bytearray</c> into a string. The only tricky part
                of this procedure is that after the transformation process the number
                represented by the chunk may end up significantly smaller than the
                original. If this is the case we may need to add a leading zero to make
                sure that all of the chunks are the same length when we concatenate
                them back together again. The extra zeros are prepended to any chunk by
                using the string repetition operator in the expression
                <c>"0" * ((chunk_size) - clen) % 2)</c> where <c>chunk_size</c> represents the
                number of digits that should be present in the string and <c>clen</c>
                represents the actual number.</p>
