  <title>Objectives</title>
  <p>The goals for this chapter are as follows:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>To understand that complex problems that may otherwise be difficult
                    to solve may have a simple recursive solution.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To learn how to formulate programs recursively.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To understand and apply the three laws of recursion.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To understand recursion as a form of iteration.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To implement the recursive formulation of a problem.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To understand how recursion is implemented by a computer system.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
