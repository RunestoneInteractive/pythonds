  <title>Exploring a Maze</title>
  <p>In this section we will look at a problem that has relevance to the
            expanding world of robotics: how do you find your way out of a maze? If you have
            a Roomba vacuum cleaner for your dorm room (don't all college students?)
            you will wish that you could reprogram it using what you have learned in
            this section. The problem we want to solve is to help our turtle find
            its way out of a virtual maze. The maze problem has roots as deep as the
            Greek myth about Theseus, who was sent into a maze to kill the Minotaur.
            Theseus used a ball of thread to help him find his way back out again
            once he had finished off the beast. In our problem we will assume that
            our turtle is dropped down somewhere into the middle of the maze and
            must find its way out. Look at <xref ref="fig-mazescreen"/> to get an idea of
            where we are going in this section.</p>
  <p xml:id="recursion_fig-mazescreen" names="fig_mazescreen"><term>Figure 4.12:</term> The Finished Maze Search Program</p>
  <figure align="center">
    <image source="Recursion/Figures/maze.png" width="480px%"/>
  </figure>
  <p>To make it easier for us we will assume that our maze is divided up into
            squares. Each square of the maze is either open or occupied by a
            section of wall. The turtle can only pass through the open squares of
            the maze. If the turtle bumps into a wall, it must try a different
            direction. The turtle will require a systematic procedure to find its
            way out of the maze. Here is the procedure:</p>
  <p>
    <ol marker="1">
      <li>
        <p>From our starting position we will first try going north one square
                    and then recursively try our procedure from there.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If we are not successful by trying a northern path as the first step
                    then we will take a step to the south and recursively repeat our
                    procedure.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If south does not work then we will try a step to the West as our
                    first step and recursively apply our procedure.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If north, south, and west have not been successful then we will apply the
                    procedure recursively from a position one step to our east.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If none of these directions works then there is no way to get out of
                    the maze and we fail.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>Now that sounds pretty easy, but there are a couple of details to talk
            about first. Suppose we take our first recursive step by going north. By
            following our procedure, our next step would also be to the north. But if
            the north is blocked by a wall, we must look at the next step of the
            procedure and try going to the south. Unfortunately, that step to the
            south brings us right back to our original starting place. If we apply
            the recursive procedure from there, we will just go back one step to the
            North and be in an infinite loop. So we must have a strategy to
            remember where we have been. In this case we will assume that we have a
            bag of bread crumbs we can drop along our way. If we take a step in a
            certain direction and find that there is a bread crumb already on that
            square, we know that we should immediately back up and try the next
            direction in our procedure. As we will see when we look at the code for
            this algorithm, backing up is as simple as returning from a recursive
            function call.</p>
  <p>As we do for all recursive algorithms, let us review the base cases. Some
            of them you may already have guessed based on the description in the
            previous paragraph. In this algorithm, there are four base cases to
            consider:</p>
  <p>
    <ol marker="1">
      <li>
        <p>The turtle has run into a wall. Since the square is occupied by a
                    wall, no further exploration can take place.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The turtle has found a square that has already been explored. We do
                    not want to continue exploring from this position so we don't get into a loop.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We have found an outside edge, not occupied by a wall. In other words,
                    we have found an exit from the maze.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We have explored a square unsuccessfully in all four directions.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>For our program to work we will need to have a way to represent the
            maze. <xref ref="fig-exmaze"/> is an example of a maze data file.</p>

  <p>To make this even more interesting we are going to use the <c>turtle</c>
            module to draw and explore our maze so we can watch this algorithm in
            action. The <c>Maze</c> object will provide the following methods for us to use
            in writing our search algorithm:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><c>__init__</c> Reads in a data file representing a maze, initializes
                    the internal representation of the maze, and finds the starting
                    position for the turtle.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><c>draw_maze</c> Draws the maze in a window on the screen.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><c>update_position</c> Updates the internal representation of the maze
                    and changes the position of the turtle in the window.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><c>is_exit</c> Checks to see if the current position is an exit from the
                    maze.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>The <c>Maze</c> class also overloads the index operator <c>[]</c> so that our
            algorithm can easily access the status of any particular square.</p>

  <p>The internal representation of the maze is a list of
            lists. Each row of the <c>maze_list</c> instance variable is also a list.
            This secondary list contains one character per square using the
            characters described above. For the data file in <xref ref="fig-exmaze"/> the
            internal representation looks like the following:</p>

  <p>The <c>update_position</c> method, as shown in <xref ref="lst-maze-update"/> uses the
            same internal representation to see if the turtle has run into a wall.
            It also updates the internal representation with a <q>.</q> or <q>-</q> to
            indicate that the turtle has visited a particular square or if the
            square is part of a dead end. In addition, the <c>update_position</c> method
            uses two helper methods, <c>move_turtle</c> and <c>drop_bread_crumb</c>, to
            update the view on the screen.</p>

  <p>Finally, the <c>is_exit</c> method uses the current position of the turtle
            to test for an exit condition. An exit condition occurs whenever the turtle
            has navigated to the edge of the maze, either row zero or column zero,
            or the far-right column or the bottom row.</p>

  <p>Let's examine the code for the search function which we call

            that this function takes three parameters: a <c>Maze</c> object, the starting
            row, and the starting column. This is important because as a recursive
            function the search logically starts again with each recursive call.</p>

</input>
  </program>
  <p>As you look through the algorithm you will see that the first thing the
            code does (line 3) is call <c>update_position</c>. This is simply to help
            you visualize the algorithm so that you can watch exactly how the turtle
            explores its way through the maze. Next the algorithm checks for the
            first three of the four base cases: Has the turtle run into a wall (lines
            6)? Has the turtle circled back to a square already explored (line 9)?
            Has the turtle found an exit (line 12)? If none of these conditions is
            true then we continue the search recursively.</p>
  <p>You will notice that in the recursive step there are four recursive
            calls to <c>search_from</c>. It is hard to predict how many of these
            recursive calls will be used since they are all connected by <c>or</c>
            statements. If the first call to <c>search_from</c> returns <c>True</c> then
            none of the last three calls would be needed. You can interpret this as
            meaning that a step to <c>(row - 1, column)</c> (or north if you want to think
            geographically) is on the path leading out of the maze. If there is not
            a good path leading out of the maze to the north then the next recursive
            call is tried, this one to the south. If south fails then try west, and
            finally east. If all four recursive calls return <c>False</c> then we have
            found a dead end. You should download or type in the whole program and
            experiment with it by changing the order of these calls.</p>
  <p>The complete program is shown in <xref ref="recursion_completemaze"/>.  This program uses the data file <c>maze2.txt</c> shown below.
            Note that it is a much more simple example file in that the exit is very close to the starting position of the turtle.</p>

  <note>
    <title>Self Check</title>
    <p>Modify the maze search program so that the calls to <c>search_from</c> are in a different order.
                Watch the program run. Can you explain why the behavior is different?
                Can you predict what path the turtle will follow for a given change in order?</p>
