  <title>Complex Recursive Problems</title>
  <p>In the previous sections we looked at some problems that are relatively
            easy to solve and some graphically interesting problems that can help
            us gain a mental model of what is happening in a recursive algorithm. In
            this and the following sections we will look at some problems that are really difficult to
            solve using an iterative programming style but are very elegant and easy
            to solve using recursion. We will finish up by looking at a deceptive
            problem that at first looks like it has an elegant recursive solution
            but in fact does not.</p>
