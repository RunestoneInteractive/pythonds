  <title>What Is Recursion?</title>
  <p><term>Recursion</term> is a method of solving problems that involves breaking a
            problem down into smaller and smaller subproblems until you get to a
            small enough problem that it can be solved trivially. Usually recursion
            involves a function calling itself. While it may not seem like much on
            the surface, recursion allows us to write elegant solutions to problems
            that may otherwise be very difficult to program.</p>
