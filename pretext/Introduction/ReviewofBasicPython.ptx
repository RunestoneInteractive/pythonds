  <title>Review of Basic Python</title>
  <p>In this section, we will review the programming language Python and also
            provide some more detailed examples of the ideas from the previous
            section. If you are new to Python or find that you need more information
            about any of the topics presented, we recommend that you consult a resource such as
            <url href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/" visual="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/"><q>The Python Language Reference</q></url>,
            <url href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" visual="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/"><q>The Python Tutorial</q></url>, or other documents
            available at <url href="https://docs.python.org/" visual="https://docs.python.org/">https://docs.python.org/</url>.
            Our goal
            here is to reacquaint you with the language and also reinforce some of
            the concepts that will be central to later chapters.</p>
  <p>Python is a modern, easy-to-learn, object-oriented programming language.
            It has a powerful set of built-in data types and easy-to-use control
            constructs. Since Python is an interpreted language, it is most easily
            reviewed by simply looking at and describing interactive sessions. You
            should recall that the interpreter displays the familiar <c>&gt;&gt;&gt;</c> prompt
            and then evaluates the Python construct that you provide. For example,</p>
  <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Algorithms and Data Structures")
Algorithms and Data Structures</pre>
  <p>shows the prompt, the <c>print</c> function, the result, and the next
            prompt.</p>
