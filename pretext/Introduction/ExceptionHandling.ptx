  <title>Exception Handling</title>
  <p>There are two types of errors that typically occur when writing
            programs. The first, known as a <em>syntax error</em>, simply means that the
            programmer has made a mistake in the structure of a statement or
            expression. For example, it is incorrect to write a for statement and
            forget the colon.</p>
  <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(10)
File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
    for i in range(10)
                    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax</pre>
  <p>In this case, the Python interpreter has found that it cannot complete
            the processing of this instruction since it does not conform to the
            rules of the language. Syntax errors are usually more frequent when you
            are first learning a language.</p>
  <p>The other type of error, known as a <em>logic error</em>, denotes a situation
            where the program executes but gives the wrong result. This can be due
            to an error in the underlying algorithm or an error in your translation
            of that algorithm. In some cases, logic errors lead to very bad
            situations such as trying to divide by zero or trying to access an item
            in a list where the index of the item is outside the bounds of the list.
            In this case, the logic error leads to a runtime error that causes the
            program to terminate. These types of runtime errors are typically called
            <term>exceptions</term>.</p>
  <p>Most of the time, beginning programmers simply think of exceptions as
            fatal runtime errors that cause the end of execution. However, most
            programming languages provide a way to deal with these errors that will
            allow the programmer to have some type of intervention if they so
            choose. In addition, programmers can create their own exceptions if they
            detect a situation in the program execution that warrants it.</p>
  <p>When an exception occurs, we say that it has been <em>raised</em>. You can
            <em>handle</em> the exception that has been raised by using a <c>try</c>
            statement. For example, consider the following session that asks the
            user for an integer and then calls the square root function from the
            math library. If the user enters a value that is greater than or equal
            to 0, the print will show the square root. However, if the user enters a
            negative value, the square root function will report a <c>ValueError</c>
            exception.</p>
  <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_number = int(input("Please enter an integer "))
Please enter an integer -23
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(math.sqrt(a_number))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ValueError: math domain error</pre>
  <p>We can handle this exception by calling the <c>print</c> function from within a
            <c>try</c> block. A corresponding <c>except</c> block <q>catches</q> the exception
            and prints a message back to the user in the event that an exception
            occurs. For example:</p>
  <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; try:
...   print(math.sqrt(a_number))
... except:
...   print("Bad value for the square root function")
...   print("Using the absolute value instead")
...   print(math.sqrt(abs(a_number)))
...
Bad value for the square root function
Using the absolute value instead
4.795831523312719</pre>
  <p>will catch the fact that an exception is raised by <c>sqrt</c> and will
            instead print the messages back to the user and use the absolute value
            to be sure that we are taking the square root of a non-negative number.
            This means that the program will not terminate but instead will continue
            on to the next statements.</p>
  <p>It is also possible for a programmer to cause a runtime exception by
            using the <c>raise</c> statement. For example, instead of calling the
            square root function with a negative number, we could have checked the
            value first and then raised our own exception. The code fragment below
            shows the result of creating a new <c>RuntimeError</c> exception. Note that
            the program would still terminate, but now the exception that caused the
            termination is something explicitly created by the programmer.</p>
  <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; if a_number &lt; 0:
...   raise RuntimeError("You can't use a negative number")
... else:
...   print(math.sqrt(a_number))
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
RuntimeError: You can't use a negative number</pre>
  <p>There are many kinds of exceptions that can be raised in addition to the
            <c>RuntimeError</c> shown above. See the Python reference manual for a list
            of all the available exception types and for how to create your own.</p>
