  <title>Why Study Algorithms?</title>
  <p>Computer scientists learn by experience. We learn by seeing others solve
            problems and by solving problems by ourselves. Being exposed to
            different problem-solving techniques and seeing how different algorithms
            are designed helps us to take on the next challenging problem that we
            are given. By considering a number of different algorithms, we can begin
            to develop pattern recognition so that the next time a similar problem
            arises, we are better able to solve it.</p>
  <p>Algorithms are often quite different from one another. Consider the
            example of <c>sqrt</c> seen earlier (see Figure 1.1). It is entirely possible that there are
            many different ways to implement the details to compute the square root
            function. One algorithm may use many fewer resources than another. One
            algorithm might take 10 times as long to return the result as the other.
            We would like to have some way to compare these two solutions. Even
            though they both work, one is perhaps <q>better</q> than the other. We might
            suggest that one is more efficient or that one simply works faster or
            uses less memory. As we study algorithms, we can learn analysis
            techniques that allow us to compare and contrast solutions based solely
            on their own characteristics, not the characteristics of the program or
            computer used to implement them.</p>
  <p>In the worst-case scenario, we may have a problem that is intractable,
            meaning that there is no algorithm that can solve the problem in a
            realistic amount of time. It is important to be able to distinguish
            between those problems that have solutions, those that do not, and those
            where solutions exist but require too much time or other resources to
            work reasonably.</p>
  <p>There will often be trade-offs that we will need to identify and decide
            upon. As computer scientists, in addition to our ability to solve
            problems, we will also need to know and understand solution evaluation
            techniques. In the end, there are often many ways to solve a problem.
            Finding a solution and then deciding whether it is a good one are tasks
            that we will do over and over again.</p>
