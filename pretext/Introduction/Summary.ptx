        <p>Computer science is the study of problem solving.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Computer science uses abstraction as a tool for representing both
                    processes and data.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Abstract data types allow programmers to manage the complexity of a
                    problem domain by hiding the details of the data.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Python is a powerful, yet easy-to-use, object-oriented language.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Lists, tuples, and strings are built in Python sequential
                    collections.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Dictionaries and sets are nonsequential collections of data.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Classes allow programmers to implement abstract data types.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Programmers can override standard methods as well as create new
                    methods.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Classes can be organized into hierarchies.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A class constructor should always invoke the constructor of its
                    parent before continuing on with its own data and behavior.</p>
