  <title>Why Study Data Structures and Abstract Data Types?</title>
  <p>To manage the complexity of problems and the problem-solving process,
            computer scientists use abstractions to allow them to focus on the <q>big
            picture</q> without getting lost in the details. By creating models of the
            problem domain, we are able to utilize a better and more efficient
            problem-solving process. These models allow us to describe the data that
            our algorithms will manipulate in a much more consistent way with
            respect to the problem itself.</p>
  <p>Earlier, we referred to procedural abstraction as a process that hides
            the details of a particular function to allow the user or client to view
            it at a very high level. We now turn our attention to a similar idea,
            that of <term>data abstraction</term>. An <term>abstract data type</term>, sometimes
            abbreviated <term>ADT</term>, is a logical description of how we view the data
            and the operations that are allowed without regard to how they will be
            implemented. This means that we are concerned only with what the data is
            representing and not with how it will eventually be constructed. By
            providing this level of abstraction, we are creating an
            <term>encapsulation</term> around the data. The idea is that by encapsulating the
            details of the implementation, we are hiding them from the user's view.
            This is called <term>information hiding</term>.</p>
  <p><xref ref="fig-adt"/> shows a picture of what an abstract data type is and how it
            operates. The user interacts with the interface, using the operations
            that have been specified by the abstract data type. The abstract data
            type is the shell that the user interacts with. The implementation is
            hidden one level deeper. The user is not concerned with the details of
            the implementation.</p>

  <p>The implementation of an abstract data type, often referred to as a
            <term>data structure</term>, will require that we provide a physical view of the
            data using some collection of programming constructs and primitive data
            types. As we discussed earlier, the separation of these two perspectives
            will allow us to define the complex data models for our problems without
            giving any indication as to the details of how the model will actually
            be built. This provides an <term>implementation-independent</term> view of the
            data. Since there will usually be many different ways to implement an
            abstract data type, this implementation independence allows the
            programmer to switch the details of the implementation without changing
            the way the user of the data interacts with it. The user can remain
            focused on the problem-solving process.</p>
