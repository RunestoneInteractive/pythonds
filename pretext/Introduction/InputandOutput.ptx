  <title>Input and Output</title>
  <p>We often have a need to interact with users,
            either to get data or to provide some sort of result. Most programs
            today use a dialog box as a way of asking the user to provide some type
            of input. While Python does have a way to create dialog boxes, there is
            a much simpler function that we can use. Python provides us with a
            function that allows us to ask a user to enter some data and returns a
            reference to the data in the form of a string. The function is called
            <c>input</c>.</p>
  <p>Python's function <c>input</c> takes a single parameter that is a string. This
            string is often called the <term>prompt</term> because it contains some helpful
            text prompting the user to enter something. For example, you might call
            input as follows:</p>
  <pre>a_name = input("Please enter your name: ")</pre>
  <p>Now whatever the user types after the prompt will be stored in the
            <c>a_name</c> variable. Using the <c>input</c> function, we can easily write
            instructions that will prompt the user to enter data and then
            incorporate that data into further processing. For example, in the
            following two statements, the first asks the user for their name and the
            second prints the result of some simple processing based on the string
            that is provided.</p>
  <program xml:id="strstuff" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
a_name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print("Your name in all capitals is", a_name.upper(),
      "and has length", len(a_name))
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>It is important to note that the value returned from the <c>input</c>
            function will be a string representing the exact characters that were
            entered after the prompt. If you want this string interpreted as another
            type, you must provide the type conversion explicitly. In the statements
            below, the string that is entered by the user is converted to a float so
            that it can be used in further arithmetic processing.</p>
  <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; s_radius = input("Please enter the radius of the circle ")
Please enter the radius of the circle 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; s_radius
'10'
&gt;&gt;&gt; radius = float(s_radius)
&gt;&gt;&gt; radius
10.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; diameter = 2 * radius
&gt;&gt;&gt; diameter
20.0</pre>

    <title>String Formatting</title>
    <p>We have already seen that the <c>print</c>
                function provides a very simple way to output values from a Python
                program. <c>print</c> takes zero or more parameters and displays them using
                a single blank as the default separator. It is possible to change the
                separator character by setting the <c>sep</c> argument. In addition, each
                print ends with a newline character by default. This behavior can be
                changed by setting the <c>end</c> argument. These variations are shown in
                the following session:</p>
    <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Hello")
Hello
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Hello", "World")
Hello World
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Hello", "World", sep="***")
Hello***World
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Hello", "World", end="***")
Hello World***&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>
    <p>It is often useful to have more control over the look of your output.
                Fortunately, Python provides us with an alternative called <term>formatted
                    strings</term>. A formatted string is a template in which words or spaces
                that will remain constant are combined with placeholders for variables
                that will be inserted into the string. For example, the statement</p>
    <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(a_name, "is", age, "years old.")</pre>
    <p>contains the words <c>is</c> and <c>years old</c>, but the name and the age
                will change depending on the variable values at the time of execution.
                Using a formatted string, we write the previous statement as</p>
    <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; print("%s is %d years old." % (a_name, age))</pre>
    <p>This simple example illustrates a new string expression. The <c>%</c>
                operator is a string operator called the <term>format operator</term>. The left
                side of the expression holds the template or format string, and the
                right side holds a collection of values that will be substituted into
                the format string. Note that the number of values in the collection on
                the right side corresponds with the number of <c>%</c> characters in the
                format string. Values are taken&#x2014;in order, left to right&#x2014;from the
                collection and inserted into the format string.</p>
    <p>Let's look at both sides of this formatting expression in more detail.
                The format string may contain one or more conversion specifications. A
                conversion character tells the format operator what type of value is
                going to be inserted into that position in the string. In the example
                above, the <c>%s</c> specifies a string, while the <c>%d</c> specifies an
                integer. Other possible type specifications include <c>i</c>, <c>u</c>, <c>f</c>,
                <c>e</c>, <c>g</c>, <c>c</c>, or <c>%</c>. <xref ref="introduction_tab-fmta"/> summarizes all of the
                various type specifications.</p>

                be used to left-justify or right-justify the value with a specified
                field width. Modifiers can also be used to specify the field width along
                with a number of digits after the decimal point. <xref ref="introduction_tab-fmtaddsa"/>

    <p>As mentioned, the right side of the format operator is a collection of values that
                will be inserted into the format string. The collection will be either a
                tuple or a dictionary. If the collection is a tuple, the values are
                inserted in order of position. That is, the first element in the tuple
                corresponds to the first format character in the format string. If the
                collection is a dictionary, the values are inserted according to their
                keys. In this case all format characters must use the <c>(name)</c>
                modifier to specify the name of the key.</p>
    <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; price = 24
&gt;&gt;&gt; item = "banana"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("The %s costs %d cents" % (item, price))
The banana costs 24 cents
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("The %+10s costs %5.2f cents" % (item, price))
The     banana costs 24.00 cents
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("The %+10s costs %10.2f cents" % (item, price))
The     banana costs      24.00 cents
&gt;&gt;&gt; itemdict = {"item": "banana", "cost": 24}
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("The %(item)s costs %(cost)7.1f cents" % itemdict)
The banana costs    24.0 cents</pre>
    <p>In addition to format strings that use format characters and format
                modifiers, Python strings also include a <c>format</c> method that can be
                used in conjunction with a new <c>Formatter</c> class to implement complex
                string formatting. More about these features can be found in the Python
                library reference manual.</p>
    <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; print("The {} costs {} cents".format(item, price))
The banana costs 24 cents
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("The {:s} costs {:d} cents".format(item, price))
The banana costs 24 cents</pre>
    <p>Python 3.6 introduced <term>f-strings</term>, a way to use proper variable names
                instead of placeholders. Formatting conversion symbols can still be used
                inside an f-string, but the alignment symbols are different from those used with placeholders
                (see <xref ref="introduction_tab-fstraast"/>). We are going to use this formatting
                method for the rest of the text.</p>
