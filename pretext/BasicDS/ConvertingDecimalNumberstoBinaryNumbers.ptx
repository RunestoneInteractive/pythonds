  <title>Converting Decimal Numbers to Binary Numbers</title>
  <p>In your study of computer science, you have probably been
            exposed in one way or another to the idea of a binary number. Binary
            representation is important in computer science since all values stored
            within a computer exist as a string of binary digits, a string of 0s and
            1s. Without the ability to convert back and forth between common
            representations and binary numbers, we would need to interact with
            computers in very awkward ways.</p>
  <p>Integer values are common data items. They are used in computer programs
            and computation all the time. We learn about them in math class and of
            course represent them using the decimal number system, or base 10. The
            decimal number <m>233_{10}</m> and its corresponding binary
            equivalent <m>11101001_{2}</m> are interpreted respectively as</p>
  <p>
    <m>2\times10^{2} + 3\times10^{1} + 3\times10^{0}</m>
  </p>
  <p>and</p>
  <p>
    <m>1\times2^{7} + 1\times2^{6} + 1\times2^{5} + 0\times2^{4} + 1\times2^{3} + 0\times2^{2} + 0\times2^{1} + 1\times2^{0}</m>
  </p>
  <p>But how can we easily convert integer values into binary numbers? The
            answer is an algorithm called Divide by 2 that uses a stack to keep
            track of the digits for the binary result.</p>
  <p>The Divide by 2 algorithm assumes that we start with an integer greater
            than 0. A simple iteration then continually divides the decimal number
            by 2 and keeps track of the remainder. The first division by 2 gives
            information as to whether the value is even or odd. An even value will
            have a remainder of 0 and will have the digit 0 in the ones place. An
            odd value will have a remainder of 1 and will have the digit 1 in the
            ones place. We think about building our binary number as a sequence of
            digits; the first remainder we compute will actually be the last digit
            in the sequence. As shown in <xref ref="i102_id1fig-decbin"/>, we again see the
            reversal property that signals that a stack is likely to be the
            appropriate data structure for solving the problem.</p>

  <p>The Python code in <xref ref="lst-binconverter"/> implements the Divide by 2
            algorithm. The function <c>divide_by_2</c> takes an argument that is a
            decimal number and repeatedly divides it by 2. Line 8 uses the built-in
            modulo operator, <c>%</c>, to extract the remainder and line 9 then pushes it
            on the stack. After the division process reaches 0, a binary string is
            constructed in lines 12-14. Line 12 creates an empty string. The binary
            digits are popped from the stack one at a time and appended to the
            right-hand end of the string. The binary string is then returned.</p>

def divide_by_2(decimal_num):
    rem_stack = Stack()

    while decimal_num &gt; 0:
        rem = decimal_num % 2
        rem_stack.push(rem)
        decimal_num = decimal_num // 2

    bin_string = ""
    while not rem_stack.is_empty():
        bin_string = bin_string + str(rem_stack.pop())

    return bin_string

  <p>The algorithm for binary conversion can easily be extended to perform
            the conversion for any base. In computer science it is common to use a
            number of different encodings. The most common of these are binary,
            octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16).</p>
  <p>The decimal number <m>233</m> and its corresponding octal and
            hexadecimal equivalents <m>351_{8}</m> and <m>E9_{16}</m> are
            interpreted as</p>
  <p>
    <m>3\times8^{2} + 5\times8^{1} + 1\times8^{0}</m>
  </p>
  <p>and</p>
  <p>
    <m>14\times16^{1} + 9\times16^{0}</m>
  </p>
  <p>The function <c>divide_by_2</c> can be modified to accept not only a decimal
            value but also a base for the intended conversion. The <q>Divide by 2</q>
            idea is simply replaced with a more general <q>Divide by base.</q> A new
            function called <c>base_converter</c>, shown in <xref ref="lst-baseconverter"/>,
            takes a decimal number and any base between 2 and 16 as parameters. The
            remainders are still pushed onto the stack until the value being
            converted becomes 0. The same left-to-right string construction
            technique can be used with one slight change. Base 2 through base 10
            numbers need a maximum of 10 digits, so the typical digit characters 0
            through 9 work fine. The problem comes when we go
            beyond base 10. We can no longer simply use the remainders, as they are
            themselves represented as two-digit decimal numbers. Instead we need to
            create a set of digits that can be used to represent those remainders
            beyond 9.</p>

        new_string = new_string + digits[rem_stack.pop()]

  <p>A solution to this problem is to extend the digit set to include some
            alphabet characters. For example, hexadecimal uses the ten decimal
            digits along with the first six alphabet characters for the 16 digits.
            To implement this, a digit string is created (line 5 in
            <xref ref="lst-baseconverter"/>) that stores the digits in their corresponding
            positions. 0 is at position 0, 1 is at position 1, A is at position 10,
            B is at position 11, and so on. When a remainder is removed from the
            stack, it can be used to index into the digit string and the correct
            resulting digit can be appended to the answer. For example, if the
            remainder 13 is removed from the stack, the digit D is appended to the
            resulting string.</p>
