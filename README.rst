Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python
================================================================

This book began as a paper book, first published by Franklin Beedle & Associates back in 2005.  Written by Brad Miller and David Ranum.  We are grateful for the vision of Jim Leisy who gave us permission to take our text and publish it online as an interactive textbook.

Getting Started
===============

We have tried to make it as easy as possible for you to build and use this book.  

1. You can see and read this book online at `interactivepython.org <http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html>`_

2.  You can build it and host it yourself in just a few simple steps:

    1.  ``pip install -r requirements.txt``  -- Should install everything you need
    2.  ``runestone build`` -- will build the html and put it in ``./build/pythonds``
    3.  ``runestone serve``   -- will start a webserver and serve the pages locally from ``./build/pythonds``
